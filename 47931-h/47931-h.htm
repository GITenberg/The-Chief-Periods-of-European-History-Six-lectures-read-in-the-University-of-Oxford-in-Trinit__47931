  <h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">These</span>
are the Lectures referred to in the last paragraph
of the Preface to the course on the “Methods of Historical
Study,” lately published. I have added to them the second
of two articles which appeared in the Contemporary
Review for 1884. The former of them, “Some Neglected
Periods of European History,” I have not reprinted, as its
substance will be found in the present course. The second,
“Greek Cities under Roman Rule,” as dealing somewhat
more in detail with some points which are barely glanced
at in the present course, seemed to make a fitting <a href="#Ch_7">Appendix</a>
to it.</p>

<p>I find that the same thought as to the political result
of modern scientific inventions which is brought out at
pp. <a href="#Page_184">184</a>, <a href="#Page_185">185</a> of these Lectures is also brought out in the
Lecture at Edinburgh, reprinted in my little book “Greater
Greece and Greater Britain,” published last May. This
kind of thing is always likely to happen in lectures given
in different places. It seemed to me that the thought
came naturally in both lectures, and that either would
lose something by its being struck out. As for those who
may be so unlucky as to read both, I can only say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
a thought which is worth suggesting once is worth suggesting
twice. At least I have often found it so in the
writings of others, specially in those of Mr. Grote.</p>

<p>The two courses of Oxford lectures which have now
been printed are both introductory. In this present
course the division into periods which is attempted is, on
the face of it, only one among many which might be made.
Another man might divide on some principle altogether
different; I might myself divide on some other principle
in another course of lectures. My present object was to
set forth as strongly as possible, at the beginning of my
teaching here, the main outlines of European history, as
grouped round its central point, the Roman power. The
main periods suggested by such a view of things are those
which concern the growth and the dying-out of that power&mdash;Europe
before the growth of Rome&mdash;Europe with Rome,
in one shape or another, as her centre&mdash;Europe since Rome
has practically ceased to be. When this main outline, a
somewhat formal one, has once been established, it is easy
at once to fill in and to subdivide in an endless number of
ways and from an endless number of points of view. Thus
I have at present little to do with the political developement
of particular nations. Of some branches of that
subject I have treated at some length in other shapes; I
may, in the course of my work here, have to treat of others.
But they are not my subject now. Nor have I now to
deal with the great events and the great institutions of
Europe, except so far as they helped to work out the one
main outline which I have tried to draw. The power of
the Popes may be looked at in a thousand ways; it con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>cerns
me now only in its strictly Roman aspect, as one, and
the greatest, of the survivals of Roman power. The great
French Revolution again may be looked on in a thousand
ways. It concerns me now as having led to the sweeping
away of the last relics of the old Roman tradition, and as
having set up for a while the most memorable of conscious
imitations of the Roman power. I say all this, that no one
may be disappointed if he fails to find in this thin volume
even a summary of all European history, much less a
philosophical discussion of all European history. My
business now is simply to draw an outline, ready either
for myself or for others to fill up in various ways.</p>

<p>These two introductory courses make up the result of my
public work as Professor during my first year of office,
1884-5. Besides these, there was the minute study of
Gregory of Tours with a smaller class, followed by the like
study of Paul the Deacon. In my second year, 1885-6, I
have, besides this study of texts, been engaged, as I said in
my former Preface, with public lectures of a much more
minute kind, on the history of the Teutonic nations in
Gaul. These I do not design to publish as lectures. If I
live long enough, I trust to make my way through them to
an older subject of mine, the Teutonic settlements in Britain.
Neither the history of Gaul nor the history of Britain in
the fifth century <small>A.D.</small> can be fully understood&mdash;it follows
that the whole later history of the two lands cannot be
fully understood&mdash;without comparing it with the history
of the other land. In dealing with Goths, Burgundians,
and Franks, the comparison and contrast with Angles,
Saxons, and Jutes, if it sometimes passes out of the imme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>diate
sight, must never be allowed to pass out of the mind’s
eye. The broad light of the history of Gaul is the best
comment on the yet more instructive darkness of the
history of Britain.</p>

<p>This subject brings me at once within the range of controversy.
I believe that the doctrine for which I have
struggled so long, the doctrine, as I have somewhere put
it epigramatically, that we, the English people, are ourselves
and not somebody else, is now often held to be altogether
set aside. Only a few old-fashioned people like
myself are thought likely to maintain it. Yet, whenever
I come across these new lights, I always begin to doubt
whether those who kindle them have ever minutely contrasted
the circumstances or the results of the Teutonic
settlements in Britain with those of the better known
Teutonic settlements in Gaul. Now this is the very root
of the matter; in discoursing of the phænomena of Gaul,
I have always had an eye to the phænomena of Britain,
and I trust some day, if I am ever able to work through
my materials, to set forth the contrast in full. To this
object the lectures which I am now gradually giving will,
I hope, serve; but it will be best to put no essential part
of them forth to the world till I can deal with the subject
as a whole. Till then I will simply put on record, for the
benefit of those who may have heard statements attributed
to me which they have certainly not read in my writings,
that I have nowhere said, because I never thought, that
every one Briton was necessarily killed, even in those
parts of Britain which became most thoroughly Teutonic.
At the same time, I think that every one who really reads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
his Gregory and his Bæda, every one who carefully
compares the map of Gaul with the map of Britain, every
one who stops to think over the history of the French
and the English tongues&mdash;and the history of the Welsh
tongue too will not do him any harm&mdash;may possibly
come to the conclusion that the doctrine that Englishmen
after all are Englishmen has really some little to be said
for it.</p>

  <h2>LECTURE I.<br />
  EUROPE BEFORE THE ROMAN POWER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span>
my first course of public lectures I did my best
to speak in a general way of the nature of historical
study, of its kindred pursuits, of the difficulties by
which it is beset and of the most hopeful means of
overcoming them. I spoke of the nature of the evidence
with which we have to deal in the search after
historic truth, and of the nature of the witnesses by
whom that evidence is handed down to us. In future
courses I trust to apply the principles which I then
strove to lay down to the study of some of the most
memorable periods since the point at which, if at
any point, the special business of this chair begins.
That we have ruled to be the point at which the Teutonic
and Slavonic nations first began to play a chief
part in the great drama of the history of Western man.
In the present term I ask your attention to a course
which will attempt to fill a place intermediate between
these two, and which may naturally serve as a link between
them. Now that we have laid down rules for
the general guidance of our studies, while we are looking
forward to a more minute dealing with the history
of some specially memorable lands and times, we may,
as the intermediate stage, do our best to part off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
history of man, such parts of it at least as concern us,
into a few great and strongly-marked periods. In my
former course, while taking a very general view of my
whole subject, I did not feel myself bound to keep
within any artificial limits, whether of my own fixing
or of any other man’s. When speaking of evidence and
of authorities, I drew my illustrations as freely from
centuries before our æra as from centuries after it.
In my present course I must make a yet more direct
and open raid into the territories of my ancient
brother. The history of the Teuton and the Slave,
since the days when those races came to the forefront
of the nations in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh
centuries of our æra, will be simply unintelligible if
we do not attempt at least a general picture of that
elder world into which they made their way, and of
the course of events which gave that world the shape
in which they found it. But my sojourn in the lands
which are ruled to belong to another will not be a
long one; before a
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: xenêlasia]">ξενηλασία</span>
or an Alien Act can be
hurled at me, I shall be gone. It will be only for
the space of about a thousand years that I need tarry
beyond the frontier which after all is a frontier of
my own choosing. And I shall always welcome my
ancient brother on a return visit of at least the same
length. If I claim to walk lightly at his side through
the ages between the first Olympiad and the great
Teutonic invasion of Gaul, I bid him walk more
steadily, more abidingly, at my side through the ages
between the Teutonic invasion of Gaul and the Ottoman
conquest of Trebizond. In my next academic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
year I shall not need to ask leave to play truant
even for so short a space as I have spoken of. My
main subject will then lie fully within the barrier.
We shall cross the Rhine and the Channel with the
Vandal and the Saxon of the fifth century. And if
it may still be sometimes needful to look back to
Arminius and Ariovistus, to remember that men of
our own stock fought against Gaius Julius and Gaius
Marius, we can in return again call on our elder
brethren to look forward for a far longer space, to
assure them that we hold them thoroughly at home,
not only in the Rome, Western or Eastern, of any
age, but in the Aquæ Grani of Frankish Cæsars and
in the Jerusalem of Lotharingian Kings.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one truth which in one sense I need not
set forth again&mdash;it has been my lot to set it forth
so often&mdash;but which I must none the less set forth
almost every time that I open my mouth among you,
for it must be the groundwork of my whole teaching,
as it is the groundwork of all sound historic teaching.
This is the truth that the centre of our studies, the
goal of our thoughts, the point to which all paths
lead and the point from which all paths start again,
is to be found in Rome and her abiding power. It
is, as I said the first time I came before you, one of
the greatest of the evils which spring from our artificial
distinctions where there are no distinctions in
nature, from our formal barriers where there are no
barriers in fact, that this greatest and simplest of
historic truths is thereby wholly overshadowed. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
who ends his work in 476 and he who begins his
work in 476 can neither of them ever understand in
its fulness the abiding life of Rome, neither can fully
grasp the depth and power of that truest of proverbial
sayings which speaks of Rome as the Eternal City.
And none but those who have thoroughly grasped the
place of Rome in the history of the world can ever
fully understand the most notable historic feature of
the age in which we ourselves live. We live in an
age from which Rome has passed away, an age at
least in which Rome has lost her headship. And, by
one of the wonderful cycles of history, the Romeless
world from which Rome has passed away is in not a
few points a return to the elder Romeless world on
which Rome had not yet risen. In both alike the
European world lacks a centre; in both alike, each
city or nation does what is right in its own eyes,
without even the theory of a controlling power.
The fuller carrying out of this analogy I keep for
the last lecture of the present course. I have now
only to divide my subject into three great and marked
periods. We have Europe before the headship of
Rome arose. We have Europe under the headship
of Rome, even if that headship was sometimes disputed
and divided. Lastly, we have Europe since the headship
of Rome has altogether passed away. It is the
first of these three periods of which I wish to give
such a sketch to-day as may at least put it in its
right relation to the periods which follow it.</p>

<p>But there is one aspect in which all those periods
form one whole; there is one tie which binds all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
three together; there has been one abiding duty
which has been laid on Aryan Europe in all her
phases, before Rome, under Rome, and after Rome.
One “question” has, in the cant of the day, been
“awaiting its solution,” from the beginning of recorded
history, and from a time long before recorded
history. That is the question on which a shallow
sneerer, in the lucky wisdom of his blindness, bestowed
the epithet of “Eternal.” Happily indeed
did he transfer to that abiding strife the epithet of
the city whose sons bore so long and mighty a part
in it. It is the “Eternal Eastern Question,” the
undying question between the civilization of the
West and the barbarism of the East, a question
which has here and there taken into its company
such side issues as the strife between freedom and
bondage, between Christendom and Islam, but which
is in its essence simply that yet older strife of whose
earlier stages Herodotus so well grasped the meaning.
It is a strife which has, as far as we can look back,
put on the familiar shape of a strife between East
and West. And in that abiding strife, that Eternal
Question, the men of the Eternal City, Scipio and
Sulla, Trajan and Julian, played their part well indeed;
but it was waged before them and after them as far
back as the days of Agamemnôn and Achilleus, as
near to the present moment as the days of Codrington
and Skobeleff. In all ages, from the earliest to
the latest, before the championship passed to Rome
and after it had passed away from Rome, two great
and abiding duties have been laid on Aryan Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and on the several powers of Aryan Europe. They
have been called on to develope the common institutions
of the great family within its own borders;
and they have been called on to defend those borders
and those institutions against the inroads of the barbarian
from without.</p>

<p>When our historic scene first opens, those twofold
duties were laid on a small branch of the European
family, and that the branch that dwelled nearest to
the lands of the enemy. It is not without a cause
that those lands of Europe which lie nearest to
Asia&mdash;we might almost add, those lands of Asia
which are historically part of Europe&mdash;are in their
physical construction the most European of European
lands. Europe is the continent of islands,
peninsulas, and inland seas; the lands round the
Ægæan, its Asiatic as well as its European shore,
form more thoroughly a world of islands, peninsulas,
and inland seas than any other part of Europe or of
the world. The Greek land was made for its people,
and the Greek people for their land. I remember well
the saying of one in this place with whom geographical
insight is an instinct, that neither the Greeks in any
other land nor any other people in Greece could have
been what the Greeks in Greece actually were. The
mission of the Greek race was to be the teachers, the
lights, the beacons, of mankind, but not their rulers.
They were to show what man could be, in a narrow
space and in a short space of time; they were to
show every faculty developed to its highest point, to
give models of every form of political constitution, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
every form of intellectual life, to bring to perfection
among themselves and to hand on to all future ages
that most perfect form of human speech, a living
knowledge of which is still the one truest test of the
highest culture. Greece was given to be the mistress
of the world in the sense of being the world’s highest
intellectual teacher; it was not hers to be the
mistress of the world in the sense in which that
calling fell to another of the great peninsulas of
southern Europe. Deep and abiding as has been the
influence of old Greece on every later age, her influence
has been almost wholly indirect; it has been
an influence of example, of precept, of warning; it
has not been an influence of direct cause and effect.
In one sense the world could never have been what
it now is if the men of old Hellas had not lived and
fought and thought and sung. But it is in another
sense from that in which we say that the world could
not be what it now is if the men of old Rome had
not lived and fought, and&mdash;we will not say thought
and sung, but ruled and judged the nations. It is
indeed no small thought, it is one of the most
quickening and ennobling of thoughts, that those
men of Hellas were our kinsfolk, men of the same
great family as ourselves, men whose institutions and
whose speech are simply other and older forms of
the speech and institutions of our own folk. The
ancient lore alike of Greece and of England puts on
a keener charm when we see in the <i>Agorê</i> before
Ilios the same gathering under well nigh the same
forms as we see in the <i>Marzfeld</i> beneath the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Rheims and in the <i>Gemót</i> beneath the walls of
London. We seem more at home alike in either
age when we see the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: hetairoi]">ἑταῖροι</span>, the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: therapontes]">θεράποντες</span>, that
fought around Achilleus rise again in the true
<i>gesiðas</i>, the faithful <i>þegnas</i>, of our own folk, in
Lilla who gave his life for Eadwine and in the men
who died, thegn-like, their lord hard by, around the
corpse of Brihtnoth at Maldon. Still all this is but
likeness, example, analogy, derivation from a common
source; we are dealing, not with forefathers but
with elder brethren. The laws of Lykourgos and
Solôn have passed away; it is the laws of Servius
and Justinian that still abide. The empire of Mykênê,
the democracy of Athens, the league of Achaia, are
all things of the past. If the Empire of Rome is no
longer a thing of the present, if it has passed away,
if it is dead and buried, it is well to remember that
there are still men living who have seen its funeral.
I am myself not old enough to have seen its funeral;
but I have before now seen some look amazed when
I told them that I had lived on the earth for twelve
years along with a man who had once been Emperor
of the Romans.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The days before the Roman power may be looked
on as in some sort the preface to a volume the last
page of which is not written, as the porch of a building
which still stands and which architects to come
may still add to or take from. It is with Rome that
the chapters of the book itself begin; it is Rome that
reared the first still inhabited chambers of the house.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Or we may rather say that the tale of the days
before Rome is a summary, short and brilliant, of all
that man has done or can do. The tale of Hellas
shows us a glorified ideal of human powers, held up
to the world for a moment to show what man can
be, but to show us also that such he cannot be for
long. And herein is the highest glory of Greece;
herein is the highest value of the tongue and history
of Greece as supplying the truest and noblest teaching
for the mind of man. In no other study are we
so truly seeking knowledge simply to raise and
school the mind; in none do we so sharply draw the
still abiding line between those who have gone
through the refining furnace of those immortal
studies and the barbarians&mdash;sometimes the self-condemned
barbarians&mdash;who stand without. When we
study the tongue, the laws, the history, of our own
people, of any people of our immediate kindred, of
that people who, whether conquering or conquered,
were still the masters of us all, we are as it were
engaged in our own work, we are busy with the toil
of our own daily life; it is still something of a
business, something of a calling. In our Hellenic
studies we stand on a loftier height, we breathe a
purer air, even as the peak of Olympos overtops the
height of Alba. We master the tongue of Latium,
because it is still the tongue of no small part of the
business of practical life, because it meets us at
every turn as an essential part of our own law, our
own history, our very daily being. We master the
tongue of Hellas as being in itself the first and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
noblest form of the common speech, as the tongue
which, in its native and unborrowed strength,
brought forth the greatest master-pieces of every
form of lettered utterance, those master-pieces which
none can know save those who can follow the very
words of the poet, the orator, the philosopher
himself, and who are not at the mercy of some blind
guide who vainly strives to reproduce those living
words in ruder tongues. After long years of familiar
knowledge, we need hardly sigh for the days when
those deathless works were fresh to us. The tale of
Ilios and Ithakê, the oldest inheritance of the
common folk, the oldest picture of the common
household, is ever living, ever fresh. We can but
pity the doom of those who, by their own act or by
the act of others, are shut out from it.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The beginnings then of European history, more
strictly perhaps the beginnings of the brilliant prologue
to unbroken European history, will be found
in the borderlands of Europe and Asia, among the
islands and peninsulas of the Ægæan sea. I am
speaking now of history in the narrower sense, of
the continuous political history of man. With the
strangers who lay without the great brotherhood,
ancient as may have been their power, mighty as
may have been their works, we have to deal only
when they come across the men of our own household.
We begin in short with the first beginnings
of the recorded history of Greece, with the first
Olympiad as a conventional date, but not forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
times before the first Olympiad so far as our earliest
pictures carry us back to yet older times. I cleave
to the date which I proposed in my Inaugural
Lecture. I have to be sure come across a singular
objection from a critic in this place. I have been told
that, by beginning with the first Olympiad, I leave
out all Mahometan history. There are then, one
must think, those who believe that all Mahometan
history took place before the first Olympiad. “Felices
errore suo.” I can only heartily wish that it were so,
and that the Ottoman was a thing as dead and gone
as the Hittite. I fear that, beginning with 776 <small>B.C.</small>,
nay even if we begin with the mystic year 476 <small>A.D.</small>,
we shall still have all Mahometan history in front
of us, and that the needs of our tale will drive us to
take not a few glimpses at that side of the world.
From the very beginning we have to do with powers
which filled the same place in the world which the
Mahometan powers filled in after ages, the powers
against which our eldest brethren had to wage the
earlier stages of the strife which still is waging.
With ingenious speculations as to the earliest origin,
the earliest settlements, the earliest forms of speech,
of the Hellenic folk, I am not, in such a summary as
this, called on to concern myself. I gladly leave
them to my ancient brother. I have to deal with the
Greek when he appears on the stage of the world
as the first champion of the great cause and as
waging a strife against worthy rivals. One people
alone in the barbarian world have even the shadow
of a right to be placed side by side, to be dealt with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
as <i>ebenbürtig</i>, with the men of Hellas. In the men
of Canaan the men of Hellas had to acknowledge
rivals who were largely forerunners and in some sort
masters. Greece had ships, colonies, and commerce;
but Phœnicia had ships, colonies, and commerce in
days earlier still. How high in all the material arts
the Phœnician stood above the earliest Greek we see
in our earliest picture of Hellenic life. Not to speak
of lesser gifts, we all bear in our minds that it was
from the Phœnician that Hellas must first have learned
to carve the abiding records of man’s thought on
the stone, on the brazen or wooden tablet, on the
leaves of Egypt and on the skins of Pergamon. The
political life of Greece was her own; that assuredly
was no borrowed gift from Tyre or Sidon; yet Tyre
and Sidon and that mightier Carthage whose institutions
Aristotle studied had a political life of their
own which brought them nearer to the Hellenic level
than any other people beyond the Aryan fold. Only,
if we must admit that the men of Canaan were on
some points the teachers of the men of Hellas, yet it
was the men of Hellas and not the men of Canaan to
whom destiny had given the call to be the teachers
of the world. It is a strange destiny by which the
people who gave Greece the art of writing should
have left to us no writings to hand down to us the
thoughts and deeds of a world of their own that has
passed away. Strange destiny that, while so large
a part of the acts of the Phœnician are recorded by
Greek and Roman enemies, while the tongue of the
Phœnician may be said still to live for us in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
speech of the kindred Hebrew, yet the direct
memorials of so great a people should not go beyond
a few coins, a few inscriptions, a few ruins of cities
which once held their place among the mightiest of
the earth.</p>

<p>Our scene then opens with the picture of the Greek
while still shut up in his own special land of islands
and peninsulas. We ask not for our purposes how
and whence he came thither; we ask not the exact
measure of his kindred in blood and speech to the
other nations around him. It is enough for us that
the Greek is not wholly isolated, that he is not
merely one of the great Aryan family, but that he
is the foremost among a group of nations who are
bound to him by some closer tie than that which
binds together all the branches of the great Aryan
family. The exact degree of kindred between Greeks
and Thracians or Phrygians we may leave to other
inquirers; it is enough for us that there was the
common Aryan kindred, and seemingly something
more. But it is one of the leading facts of history
that Greece had to deal on her immediate northern
frontier, on the opposite coasts of Asia, on the
opposite coasts of Italy and Sicily, with nations
which, for historical purposes at least, were nearer
still. Those nations had, to say the least, a power of
adopting Greek ways, a power of becoming Greeks
by adoption if not by birth. The boundary line
between the Greek and the Epeirot, faint in the
earliest days of Greece, seems for some ages to be
drawn sharper and sharper. Then the tide turns;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
suddenly the Epeirots, the people of the oldest
Hellas, the guardians of the oldest of Hellenic
oracles, stand forth again in their elder character.
Molottian Pyrrhos wages Western wars as a Hellenic
champion and the kingdom of Pyrrhos settles down
at last into a well-ordered Greek confederation.</p>

<p>So it is in Macedonia; so it is in Sicily; so it is in
the Greater Hellas on Italian soil. All these lands,
and other lands beside, become, for a longer or shorter
time, part of the immediate Greek world, no less
than Attica or Peloponnêsos. Greek colonization
and Macedonian conquest had, each in its turn, a
share in the work, and both were in many lands not
a little helped by real, if unconscious, kindred on the
part of those whom colonists and conquerors found
already in possession. Every colony, every conquest,
not only won new lands for the Greek settlers themselves,
but increased the Greek nation in its wider
sense by multitudes who became Greek by adoption,
and in whose case the work of adoption was made
more easy by the existence of earlier ties of which
neither side had thought. As time goes on, as we
reach the days when Greek influences were most
widely spread over the Mediterranean lands, we may
easily trace out zones within zones, marking out the
different stages by which the Greek element grows
fainter and fainter. First there is the centre of
all, the original Hellas itself. Then there are the
genuine colonies of old Hellas, detached fragments
of Hellenic soil translated to foreign coasts. Then
there are the kindred lands whose people were fully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
adopted into the Hellenic fold. Beyond them again
lie the kingdoms ruled by Macedonian princes, where
a few great cities which we must call Greek by
the law of adoption are planted in lands which
have received at the outside only the faintest varnish
of Hellenic culture. Lastly, beyond these again, there
are the barbarian lands whose princes, like barbarian
princes in our own day, made a show of adopting
Greek speech and Greek culture, but where the foreign
tastes of the princes had no real effect on their
kingdoms, and which we cannot look on as forming
part of the Greek world in the laxest sense. Such
was Parthia; such was Pontos. Is it too much to
add to the barbarian kingdoms of the East the
mighty commonwealth of the West which had once
been in Greek eyes no less barbarian? It is no small
part of our œcumenical story to mark how far Rome
became Greek and how far Rome refused to become
Greek. The facts belong to a later time; yet in
some sort they form part of our present survey.
The Rome which brought the Greek lands step by
step, first under Roman influence, then under Roman
dominion, was a Rome which had already come
within the magic circle of Hellenic teaching; while
keeping the essential essence of the national life
untouched, while remaining truly Roman in every
political institution, in every detail of law and
government, she became Greek for every purpose of
refined and intellectual life. Nay, Rome became,
like Macedonia, a disciple that gathered in fresh
disciples. Wherever Rome’s political life spread,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
some measure, greater or less, of Greek intellectual
life spread with it.</p>

<p>The history of Europe before the Roman power is
in truth the history of the stages by which the Greek
mind made its way to this general supremacy over
the civilized world, and in some sort beyond the
bounds of the civilized world. Within the range
of this supremacy of the Greek mind comes the
narrower range of the political supremacy of powers
which were either Greek from the beginning or which
had become Greek by adoption. The supremacy of
the Greek mind has never ceased, and is still abiding.
Greek intellectual dominion has formed one side of the
whole modern world; the advance of Greek political
power has wrought the lesser, but by no means unimportant,
work of forming one of the nations of the modern
world. The modern Greek nation, meaning thereby
something more than the inhabitants either of the
existing Greek kingdom or of the continuous Hellas
of old times, is the fruit of old Greek colonization,
followed up by Macedonian conquest. I said years
ago that Alexander was the founder of the modern
Greek nation, and I say so still. This saying may
seem to shut out the work of earlier Greek colonization,
above all in those lands of Sicily and southern
Italy which we have spoken of as having been
admitted by adoption within the immediate Greek
world. The truth is that Greek colonization has
nowhere been fully lasting, it has nowhere left its
abiding traces on the modern world, except where
Macedonian conquest came to strengthen it. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
enables us to fix a boundary for the lands which
were permanently admitted within the immediate
Greek world. That boundary is the Hadriatic.
West of the Hadriatic Greek life has died out. The
outlying Greek colonies in Gaul and Spain, deep
as was their influence on Gaul, had ceased to be
Greek before the great nations of modern Europe
came into being. Even southern Italy and Sicily,
where Greek life was strengthened by their long
connexion with the Greek Rome on the Bosporos,
have ceased to be Greek for some ages. The lands
in which a series of invaders of whom Pyrrhos of
Molottis was the last and greatest strove in vain
to set up a Western Greek dominion, have fallen
away from the Greek world. But the work which
Alexander of Epeiros failed to do in the West was
largely done by his more famous nephew and namesake
in the East. If a great part of Alexander’s
conquests were but for a short time, another great
part of them was abiding. The work of Alexander
and Seleukos fixed a line fluctuating between
the Euphrates and the Tigris, as a long abiding
boundary of European dominion. It fixed Tauros, the
boundary of Alexander’s first Asiatic conquests, as a
far more abiding boundary of European life. I have
had to point out in two hemispheres, but I must
point out again, how very nearly the actual range of
the modern Greek nation agrees with the range of old
Greek colonization east of Hadria. It has advanced
at some points and it has gone back at others;
but its general extent is wonderfully the same. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
an extent which in both ages has been fixed by the
genius of the people. Nowhere out of the old continuous
Hellas does the Greek people, none the less
Greek because largely Greek by adoption, spread
from sea to sea. Throughout a large part of eastern
Europe and western Asia the Greek is the representative
of European and civilized life on the whole
sea-coast. The world of peninsulas and islands is the
world of the Greek now, exactly as it was in the
days of the Homeric Catalogue.</p>

<p>It is, as we held in our former course, with that
Catalogue, the first written record of European politics,
that our survey of Europe before the Roman Power
must open. With all who can take a general grasp
of history and who understand the nature of evidence,
the Domesday of the Empire of Mykênê, puzzling
to the mere porer over two or three arbitrarily
chosen centuries, commands full belief. We ruled it
in our former inquiry to be the highest example of
a general rule, “Credo quia impossibile.” In the
Catalogue we see the people of many islands and of
all Argos, grouped under the Bretwalda of Hellas,
already engaged in a stage, and not the earliest stage,
of the Eternal Question. Herodotus, who better knew
the meaning of the world’s history than the diplomatists
of modern days, could point, in a mythical
shape indeed, to stages earlier still. Whether there
ever was a personal Agamemnôn and a personal Odysseus
matters but little; it matters far more that the
keen eye of Ælfred, who knew the relation of an overlord
and his vassal princes, could see the relation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
between Ulixes with his two kingdoms and the <i>Casere</i>
Agamemnôn of whom he held them. That <i>Casere</i>,
kingliest among the kingly,
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileuteros]">βασιλεύτερος</span>
in the throng of
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basilêes]">βασιλῆες</span>,
is already doing the work of a Trajan or a
Frederick; he is fighting for Europe on the shores of
Asia. The work of Greek colonization has begun;
Crete, to be won again ages after from the Saracen, is
already won from the Phœnician; Rhodes is already
admitted to Hellenic fellowship, to see in after days
the might of Antigonos and the might of Mahomet
shattered beneath her walls. The southern coast of
Asia is still untouched; Milêtos is a barbarian city;
but Achilleus has won Lesbos as his own prize, and
on the mainland the work is doing which was to
make the coasts of the Hellespont and the Propontis
a foremost outpost of Greece and Europe, the land
which was to witness the first exploits of the first
crusaders and to behold the Eastern Rome rise to a
fresh life under the firm rule of the Emperors of
Nikaia. Deem we as we will as to minuter details,
as we have in the Homeric poems our first glimpse
of Aryan society in peace and war, so we have in them
our first record, if only in a poetic form, of one stage
of the great strife which changed the barbarian
peninsula of Asia into that solid home of Grecian
speech and Roman law which for ages held up
against the ceaseless inroads of the Arabian conquerors.
To the west, to the north, our range of
sight is narrower. No colonist from Argos and its
islands has made his way to Italy or Sicily; Akarnania
is still part of the vague <i>Mainland</i>, the still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
undefined <i>Epeiros</i>; Korkyra is still a land of fable on
which no settler from Corinth has set foot. But there
are signs which already point to the kindred of the
nations on both sides of the Ionian sea. The Sikel
dwells on both coasts; even of the more mysterious
Sikan we get a passing glimpse. The northern coast
of the Ægæan is known; but that coast is not yet
Hellenic; it significantly sends its warriors to fight
on the Asiatic side. Further to the north, further to
the west, all is wonder and mystery; we may as well
ask whether the poet had any conception of the site
of London as whether he had any conception of the
site of Rome. The eyes of infant Greece are still
fixed on the East; vague tidings had reached her of
the wonders of the land by the river Ægypt; the
men of Sidon were her visitors, her traffickers, in some
sort her teachers. But the wary sons of Canaan were
too wise to tell all they knew of Western lands and
Western seas. The gold of Tartêssos was as yet for
them only; for them only was the precious knowledge
that the pillars of Hêraklês&mdash;if Greece had as
yet heard their name&mdash;opened into no stream of
Ocean parting the lands of the living and the dead,
but into the boundless waters over which it was as
yet for themselves alone to spread their sails.</p>

<p>Let us take another glance at the Mediterranean
world at a later time, a time when our historic
evidence is still meagre and scattered, but when we
have begun to leave mere legend behind us. It is
one of the gains or losses of the wider study of
history that it often teaches us to look at this and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
that period with different eyes from those with which
we naturally look at them when we are engaged only
in the narrower study of special times and places.
I well remember learning, and I well remember being
startled as I learned, from the teaching of Mr. Finlay,
that the age which we commonly look on as the
most glorious in Grecian history, the fifth century
before Christ, was in truth an age of Greek decline.
The truth is that it was the greatest age in the
history of Athens, and a crowd of causes lead us at
every moment to mistake the history of Athens for
the history of Greece. What we sometimes fail to
see Herodotus saw clearly. He saw that in the
general history of the world the age of the Persian
wars was, for the Greek people as a whole, the
scattered Greek people all over the world, an age
of decline. The fact that there was a Persian war,
a Persian war waged in Greece, is enough to prove
the saying. That fact of itself shows that that process
had already begun which is still not ended, the
long and gloomy work of which Finlay steeled himself
to write the story, the History of Greece under
Foreign Domination. It is enough to prove Finlay’s
point that Milêtos had learned to groan, as thrice-betrayed
Jôannina groans still, beneath the yoke of
the barbarian. The periods when Greek influences
had most sway over the whole world are two, one
earlier, one later, than the more brilliant times of
our usual studies. The earlier is the greater; for it
is the time when Hellas grew and spread and made
wide her borders among the nations, by her own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
unaided strength, the time when Hellenic colonization
carried everywhere, not only Hellenic speech and
Hellenic arts, but the higher boon of free Hellenic
political life. In the later period Hellenic speech
and Hellenic arts are spread more widely than they
had ever been spread before; but Hellenic political
life is no longer carried with them. The external
might of Greece is wielded for her by the kings of
the adopted lands; we have passed from Hellenic
colonization to Macedonian conquest. In neither of
those periods was the most vigorous Greek life to
be found in old Greece itself; the most brilliant recorded
period of old Greece is the period between
the two, the period of our most usual Greek studies.
But it was the most brilliant because the outer
bounds of Hellas had fallen back before victorious
barbarians, and because old Greece rose up in a renewed
strength to avenge the wrongs of her colonies
and to ward off the like bondage from herself. The
Greece of the fifth century before Christ is like the
Rome of the fourth century after Christ. Its warfare
is essentially defensive; it seldom gains new
ground; it has much ado to defend old ground. It
gains victories; it wins territories; but the victories
are gained over threatening invaders, the territories
that are won are won back from the grasp of those
invaders. The work of Kimôn, the work of Agêsilaos,
answers rather to the work of Galerius and Valentinian
than to the work of those conquerors of realms
wholly new who made Sicily a Greek and Gaul a
Roman land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hard to fix on the exact moment when free
and independent Hellas&mdash;for remember that wherever
Hellênes dwell there is Hellas&mdash;had spread
itself most widely over the Mediterranean coasts.
For boundaries fluctuate, and Hellas still advanced
at some points after she had begun to fall back at
others. But we cannot be far wrong in picking out
some time not far from the beginning of the sixth
century before Christ as the most brilliant time of
the free Hellênes throughout the world. Then, as
Herodotus puts it, all Greeks were still free; it was
in the course of the next century that some Greeks
were brought under the power of barbarian masters.
If some Greek colonies were still to be planted, all
the fields of Greek colonization had already been
opened. And in most of them the Greek cities were
at the height of their power and greatness, positive
and relative; they were greater than they were in
after days, greater than the cities of old Greece were
at the same time. It is one of the truths which it
is hardest to take in, that there was a time when
Milêtos and Sybaris and Akragas, rather than Athens
or Sparta, were the greatest cities of the Hellenic
name. The like came again at a later time, when
the greatest of Greek cities were Alexandria and
Antioch. That the life of Athens and Sparta was
the more abiding proves that the Greek was after
all more at home on the soil on which he grew to be
a Greek; but the fact that, at one time the colonial,
at another the Macedonian, cities altogether outshone
the older and truer Hellas is a fact which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
should be ever borne in mind. In the great days
of the Greek colonies the greater part of the
Mediterranean coasts was divided between settlers
from Greece and settlers from Phœnicia. In the
eastern seas the Greek had the supremacy; the true
life and strength of the men of Canaan had passed
away from Sidon and Tyre to the Phœnician cities
in the western Mediterranean, to Panormos in the
great central island, to Gadeira on the Ocean, to
Utica on the Libyan coast, to the New City which
outshone her parents and elder sisters, to mighty
Carthage, chief and in course of time mistress of her
fellows. From the Ægæan islands the Phœnician
had withdrawn before the Greek; even in more distant
Cyprus the Greek had gained the upper hand.
Far to the south, on the Libyan mainland, the fertile
coast between the Egyptian and the Carthaginian
had beheld the growth of Kyrênê and her sisters of
the Greek Pentapolis. The Greek cities of Asia were
among the most flourishing in the world; the gates
of the Bosporos had been thrown open; the Pontos
was no longer the Inhospitable but the Hospitable
Sea; if the most abiding seat of Hellenic freedom,
Cherson on her Tauric peninsula, had not already
sprung into being, the path had at least been opened
for her. On the western side of her own peninsula,
Greece was creeping up the Hadriatic coast; setting
aside later settlements, setting aside doubtful
tales of earlier settlements, Akarnania was now part
of the Greek mainland, Korkyra was numbered
among Greek islands, Ambrakia, perhaps Epidamnos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and Apollônia, had begun their course; Greek culture
was spreading among the kindred nations; if
narrower Hellenic feeling forbade to the Thesprotian
and the Molottian any share in the Hellenic name,
wider and more liberal inquirers did not deny their
right. But, above all, this is the age of the greatness
of the Greek folk in the lands west of Hadria, that
greatness which so soon dwindled away, and which
adventurous kings from Sparta and Epeiros strove
in vain to restore. The Phœnician, whose settlements
once studded the eastern and southern coasts
of Sicily, is now driven into the north-western
corner of the island; the Sicilian cities are among
the foremost of the Greek name; if Syracuse is less
great than she was in days to come, it is because
Akragas and Gela have not yet fallen from their
first greatness. In southern Italy, alone in lands
out of the old home, in a peninsular land recalling
the old home, Hellas spreads from sea to sea; the
Greater Greece holds the land firmly with her
great cities; Sybaris has reached the greatness from
which she is soon to fall into utter nothingness;
Taras, not yet Latin Tarentum, has begun the long
life some traces of which hang about her even in our
own day. As for the Greek cities in the Western
Mediterranean, Massalia and her fellows, their full
day of greatness, their day of widest influence over
barbarian neighbours, had as yet hardly come. But
it was coming; the work was begun. In that day
Hellenic life is fully as vigorous and flourishing in
the Western as in the Eastern lands. Continuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Hellas lies between the two, for a moment less
brilliant, of less influence in the world, than the
two great ranges of Greek colonization on either
side of it. But when the whole Mediterranean
coast might seem to be divided between the Greek
and the Phœnician, two lands stand marked as
having supplied no home for the settlements of
either. There was the land whose day of greatness
had gone by, and the land whose day of
greatness was coming. By the banks of the Nile
the site of Alexandria still stood unnoticed by all
the wisdom of a thousand Pharaohs; the Greek
was already known in Egypt as a mercenary; he
had not yet come to reign as a Preserver and
a Benefactor. By the banks of the Tiber, Rome,
perhaps already the head of Latium, not yet aspiring
to be the head of the world or the head of Italy,
was biding her time; not yet herself conquering or
colonizing, but strong enough, along with her valiant
neighbours, to keep central Italy as an Italian land,
in which neither the men of Hellas nor the men of
Canaan should find a dwelling-place.</p>

<p>This then, from the point of view of œcumenical
history, is the time which saw the full height of
strictly Hellenic greatness, the greatness of Hellenic
commonwealths, the greatness of states which were
Greek by birth and not only Greek by adoption.
Let us pass on to the next strongly marked period,
the days, stretching not very much beyond a century
and a half, which are undoubtedly the most brilliant
days in the life of some of the greatest cities of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
elder Hellas, and which have therefore often been
mistaken for the whole history of the Greek people.
Now, as Herodotus says, we can no longer say that
all Greeks are free. In the course of the sixth
century <small>B.C.</small> the work of Mummius and Mahomet
begins; Greeks now begin to be the subjects of
foreign rulers. Barbarian powers such as Greeks
had never yet had to deal with have arisen in East
and West. Two such powers above all have come
to the front, a mighty empire in the East, a mighty
commonwealth in the West, an empire and a commonwealth
which for some generations were to be
names of fear throughout the Hellenic world. On
the one side the old barbarian powers of Asia,
powers which lay beyond the range of European
history, have given way to a new barbarian power
which forced itself within the European range, and
which we may almost say had a right to force
itself. It was not against the Hittite or the
Assyrian that the strife had to be waged, but
against the kindred Persian. An Aryan people had
been misled in their course of wandering; they had
strayed into the land of morning; they now turned
their faces towards the setting sun, but they turned
them only when it was too late, when they had
already put on the guise of the lands of their sojourn
and could show themselves among their European
kinsfolk in no light but that of barbarian invaders.
Yet we must pay our tribute to the long abiding
national life and national energy which could so often
rise again in full freshness after ages of bondage. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
was no mean people which could twice spring into
fresh being at the preaching of a national religion.
It was in truth no small mission in the world’s history
that fell to the lot of the Aryan of Persia. Once the
worthy rival of Greece, he rose again to be the
worthy rival of Rome; like the Greek, he could
lead captive successive conquerors; in the grasp of
the Saracen, in the grasp of the Turk, his old life
could still abide, and, if he bowed to the creed of
Arabia, it was only by changing it into a new shape
which made it before all things the creed of Persia.
The Lydian reaped the first-fruits of Greek subjection;
the Persian threatened to turn the whole
eastern half of Hellas, continuous and scattered, into
part of a world-wide dominion. The
King&mdash;<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span>&mdash;forestalling
in that simple word the titles and controversies
of days to come, was indeed beaten back
from old Hellas; he was beaten back from Europe;
he was for a while forced to withdraw his fleets and
armies from the Hellenic coasts of Asia. But the
fact that he had to be driven back from all of them
of itself showed what an enemy it was against whom
Greece had now to strive. For a moment Thebes
was the willing ally, Athens was the defenceless
conquest, of the lord of Susa and Ekbatana. And
after all the Persian did cut Hellas short on the side
of Asia; he even declared his will as a master in the
councils of Europe. A century had not passed
since the day of Salamis when, by the peace of
Antalkidas, the peace which the King sent down,
the Greek cities of Asia, the Greek cities of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Cyprus, were formally acknowledged to be the
King’s.</p>

<p>In the West meanwhile Hellas had to strive
against a rival yet more worthy of her rivalry, not
against a barbarian empire, but against a barbarian
commonwealth. The old Phœnicia on the Syrian
shore had fallen from its glory; its commonwealths,
still rich and flourishing, had sunk into dependencies
of the Persian power. The great field of Phœnician
enterprise now lay in the western seas. One Phœnician
city, the youngest of the great Phœnician
cities, had risen to a place in the world and the
world’s history such as the cities of the elder
Canaan had never reached. The New City, Carthage,
was now the centre and representative of Phœnician
life far more than Sidon or Tyre. Carthage, in
after days the rival of Rome, was now before all
things the rival of Greece. She was to bring Rome
nearer to destruction than was ever done by any
other power of the Mediterranean world; she was
to destroy for a season, to weaken for ever, more
than one of the greatest among the western cities
of Hellas. At the head of a mighty following of
dependencies of her own race, swollen by barbarian
subjects and mercenaries of every race, the Asiatic
city planted on the shores of Africa came nearer
than any other power of those days to rooting up
the elder life of Europe, the life of which first
Greece and then Italy was the centre. We do not
rightly take in the full significance of the struggle
which Greece went through at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
fifth century <small>B.C.</small> if we do not at every moment bear
in mind how the whole Greek folk was attacked on
both sides at once. It may or may not be true that
Xerxes entered into an actual league with Carthage;
it may or may not be true that the fight of Salamis
and the fight of Himera were fought on the same
day. True or false, both beliefs set forth the true
position of the Greek states at that moment,
threatened by Persia on one side and by Carthage
on the other. The Persian was beaten back; from
the actual soil of continuous Hellas he was beaten
back for ever. The Carthaginian was beaten back
only for a moment; he still kept his hold on Sicily;
he was yet to destroy Selinous and Akragas, to
come within a hair’s-breadth of destroying Syracuse.
In earlier days the scattered Phœnician settlements
in eastern Sicily had withdrawn before the coming
of the Greek colonists; but now the Phœnician
power was wielded by a single mighty commonwealth
which held some of its strongest outposts,
Panormos at their head, in the north-western
corner of the great island. In Sicily things seem
to have turned round; the European holds the
eastern, the Asiatic holds the western coast. And
it is now the masters of the western coast that
threaten the eastern.</p>

<p>But the Persian and the Phœnician were not the
only enemies against whom the scattered Greek
nation had to strive. Foes nearer to the Greek in
race than the Phœnician, less widely removed in
political and social institutions than the Persian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
were threatening the power and the being of one
great division of the Greek name. The second of the
great peninsulas of southern Europe, the central one
of the three, the peninsula which held Rome and
Capua and the cities of the Etruscan, was beginning
to come to the front in the drama of history. There
was as yet no sign that Italy was to be the ruling
land of the world; but there were signs that Italy
was no longer to be a land in which settlers of
foreign races might carve themselves homes at
pleasure. The name of Rome was beginning to be
heard in Hellenic ears, but it was as yet hardly a
name of fear. It was as yet the native races of
southern Italy that the Greek cities had to dread,
and Rome was for a while the enemy of their
enemies. The Persian and the Carthaginian were
strictly enemies from without; the Persian was in
every sense an invader of the soil of the oldest
Hellas; the Carthaginian was at most winning a
land in which other branches of his race had once
made settlements; but the Lucanians and the other
nations of southern Italy were, in the strictest sense,
winning back their own land from strangers. When
Kymê and Poseidônia ceased to be cities of Hellas,
in one sense the boundaries of the civilized world
fell back; in another we may say that they advanced,
as the nations of Italy began to show that
the time was come for the men of the central
peninsula to play their part in the world’s history
as well as the men of the older peninsula to the
east of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>By the middle of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> the decline
of Greece is, even on the shallowest view,
allowed to have begun. But it is commonly held to
have begun merely because the Macedonian kingdom
was beginning to step into that position of
primacy among the Greek powers which had been
held at different times by the cities of Argos, Sparta,
Athens, and Thebes. And as regards the political
life of the great Greek cities, above all, as regards
the political life of that Athens which we are so
often tempted to mistake for Greece, the change
was great indeed, sad indeed. But we must not
forget that the political decline of the great cities
of old Greece was but one part of the general
political decline of the Hellenic people, and also that
a large part of old Greece itself looked on the
change in quite another light from that in which
we are used to look at it from the purely Athenian
point of view. With the voice of Dêmosthenês
ringing in our ears, it is hard to listen to the calm
comments of Polybios, when he hands on to us the
traditions of Megalopolis and of so many other cities
by whom Philip was looked on as a friend and deliverer,
a pious crusader against the sacrilegious
Phokian. But yet more important it is to remember
that, if old Hellas lost much through the advance of
the Macedonian, the younger Hellas beyond Hadria
lost immeasureably more through the advance of the
Phœnician and the native Italian. Cry after cry
for help went up from Italy and Sicily to the
motherland in Greece. A series of adventurers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
republican and princely, crossed the sea to bear help
to their threatened brethren or to carve out a
dominion for themselves. Some went to free Greek
cities from domestic tyrants, others to free them
from the yoke of the advancing barbarian. That
men from the motherland were needed for either
work shows that the great day of the Western
Greeks had passed away, that they could no longer
keep either internal freedom or external independence
by their own strength. And, dark as is
the tale of Dionysios and Agathoklês, we cannot
wholly put out of sight that even they had a
brighter side as in some sort champions of Hellas
against the barbarian. We must not forget Dionysios
as the planter of Greek colonies on both sides of
Hadria, nor Agathoklês as the man who carried the
arms of Europe to the shores of Africa, the forerunner
of Regulus and Scipio, of Roger of Sicily and
Charles of Austria. But the mission of Diôn and
of the nobler Timoleôn, the warfare of the Spartan
and the Epeirot, of Archidamos and Alexander and
Pyrrhos, showed that the Greeks of the West could
no longer stand, even by the help of the Greeks of
the old Hellenic lands or of the lands which had
become Hellenic by adoption. Their doom was sealed;
so before long was the doom of all lands, the lands
of the Macedonian and the Carthaginian no less than
the lands of the Sicilian and the Italian Greek. But
the fall of Macedon and the fall of Carthage were yet
far distant; those lands were reaching their highest
pitch of greatness at the moment when it became plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
that all that was left for the Greeks of the West was
to become subjects or dependents of an Italian power.</p>

<p>Another point to be noticed is the close connexion
between the destiny of the Eastern and of the Western
Greeks. The Spartan princes sought for a career in
Italy because, in face of the advance of Macedonia,
there was no career left for them in old Greece.
Moreover the Epeirot kings Alexander and Pyrrhos
are themselves part of the <i>Hellênismos</i>; they are
among the chiefest signs that the Hellenic name and
culture had spread beyond the genealogical bounds
of the Hellenic nation. Their people might have an
ancient kindred with the Greeks; they themselves
might come of the blood of Achilleus; but they were
still, in the wider aspect of the time, Greeks by
adoption only. And the career of the Epeirot kings
in the West was directly suggested by the career of
the Macedonian kings in the East. Their land
looked towards Italy and Sicily yet more directly
than Macedonia looked towards Asia; and perhaps
Alexander, certainly Pyrrhos, sought to found beyond
the Hadriatic a Western Greek dominion to
balance the Eastern Greek dominion which the
Macedonians had founded beyond the Ægæan. So
it was not to be. The decree had gone forth that
Greece, in her new guise, was to leaven the East,
for a while to rule over the East, but that in the
West the political power of the Greek race was to
die out, that even its intellectual influence was
to be indirect, an influence which had to accept
Roman masters and disciples as its instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the day was coming when Rome was to rule
in the East as well as in the West; she was step by
step to draw all the Greek powers, those that were
Greek by adoption as well as those that we may call
Greek by birth, within the spell of that influence
which silently changed from alliance to subjection.
The details of that process, the picture of the world
into which Rome burst as it were in a moment, the
history in short of the third and second centuries,
have, in the common course of so-called classical
studies, met with a neglect which can be measured
only by their paramount importance in universal
history. The distinctive aspect of that age I shall
have to speak of again. I wish now to point out
how rich in political instruction of every kind, rich
perhaps beyond every other age of so-called classical
times, the age of Polybios really is. The Greek
world of his day was made up of an assemblage
of states, of every degree of power and of every
form of political constitution. There was nothing
like it in the earlier days of Greece; there was
nothing like it in the after days when Rome practically
became the world. But the Greek world of
those days gives us a lively image of the political
state of modern Europe for some ages past. The
political experience of Polybios was immeasureably
wider than that of Thucydides; he had in truth
an experience fully as wide and varied as that of
any modern statesman. Thucydides knew only the
independent city, oligarchic or democratic, and the
city which would fain be independent but was not.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
In his day kingship and federation&mdash;federation
worthy to be so called&mdash;were still in the background;
they hardly stood forth on the political
stage; kingship was not the constitution of any
acknowledged Greek power; federation was not the
constitution of any Greek power of the first or even
of the second rank. But Polybios could study, within
the range of Greek or Greek-speaking powers, every
form of kingship and every form of commonwealth.
There was the national kingship of Macedonia, the
king ruling over his own people. There was the
local kingship of Egypt, the rule of Greek kings over
a foreign nation. There was the Seleukid dominion,
fallen indeed from its old greatness, but whose
kings still kept up some memory of the position
alike of Cyrus and of Alexander, the position of the
Great King, the King of Kings, ruling over lands and
cities, Greek and barbarian, of every speech, of every
form of life, of every kind of relation to the central
power. And the Greek city-commonwealth, fully
free and independent, was still a familiar form of
political life; nor need it shock us that the purest
and noblest example of a Greek democracy was now
to be found, not at Athens but at Rhodes. But
the highest political life of Greece, above all of
old European Greece, was now to be found in the
federal states, in Polybios’ own Achaia, in gallant
and faithful Akarnania, in the adopted Greek land
of Epeiros, nay too in after days beyond the
sea, among worthy imitators of Hellenic models,
in that land of Lykia whose people, in the latest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
day as in the earliest, stand forth as the worthiest
folk of Asia, alongside of the men of Achaia,
worthiest folk of Europe. Achaia, Rhodes, Pergamon;
it was no mean lesson to be able to study
the federal commonwealth, the single city commonwealth,
the kingship of a house worthy to reign,
each standing forth in a model example of those
three several forms of government. In such a system
of states as this, instead of the simpler relations of
earlier days, we come across all the complications of
modern international politics. While the old republican
life goes on, we see beside it the working
of dynastic interests, the influence of queens and
ministers, exactly as in the modern world. Diplomacy
has its work to do, and a busy and constant work it is.
Nor is the history of these times simply the history
of petty states. Not only Macedonia and Egypt,
but Pergamon, Achaia, Rhodes, were all great powers
according to the standard of any earlier age. They
were the leading states of their own world, the chief
members of an established system in which each
held its place exactly like the states of the modern
world. Suddenly a foreign power broke in among
them, a power far stronger than any of them,
a power which came from another world beyond
their range, and which in a moment changed the
face of the world into which it entered. The suddenness
of this irruption of Rome into the Greek
world, the speed with which she sprang at once
to the first place in the East as well as in the
West, are among the most striking parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
story. They stand out in marked contrast alike
to the slow steps by which Rome had marched to
the headship of the West and to the slow steps
by which her leadership in the East was changed
into direct and universal rule. Next to the delusion
that the Empire of Rome came to an end in
476 <small>A.D.</small> stands the delusion that free Greek states
came to an end in 146 <small>B.C.</small> This last delusion
may be easier to get rid of than the other. The
third and second centuries <small>B.C.</small> have at least the
advantage of being left pretty clear from the touch
of the crammer. It is easier to write on white paper
than to make parchment ready for a palimpsest. It
may be easier to set forth the true aspect of the age
which ruled that Rome should be the head of the
world than it is to set forth the true aspect of the
age which answers to it, the age which ruled in
what shape Rome should still remain the head of the
world, though her political dominion over half her
provinces was broken in pieces.</p>

  <h2>LECTURE II.<br />
  ROME THE HEAD OF EUROPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span>
my last lecture I strove to draw a picture of the
Mediterranean lands at the moment when the Greek
world, as the Greek world had been shaped by
Macedonian conquest, a world of kingdoms, federations,
and single cities, a busy and intricate system
full of the deepest political lessons at every step,
was suddenly startled by the invasion of a power
from the West. That power had already slowly
risen to the first place in its own Western world;
it now sprang as in a moment to the first place in
the East; but, having thus sprung to the first place,
it was content to fall back on its former slow and
piecemeal course. Generations had to pass away
before the paramount influence in the Greek world
which Rome won at a single grasp was fully changed
into immediate dominion over every land and city
to which its influence had spread. Very early in
the second century <small>B.C.</small> Rome was already the paramount
power in the Greek world. She had not a
single province east of Hadria; but cities, confederations,
kingdoms, all knew that she was practically
their mistress. Late in the first century <small>A.D.</small> Rome
had many provinces east of Hadria; her immediate
dominion had become the rule, and even nominal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
independence was the exception; but there were
still free Greek cities which Vespasian deemed it
prudent to bring under his immediate dominion,
and there were not a few other free Greek cities
which Vespasian left to give Trajan an opportunity
of respecting the faith of treaties. The first step
in short was sudden and swift; every later step was
slow; but the first step carried every later step
with it as its necessary consequence. In the interval
between the First and Second Punic Wars,
Rome appeared east of the Hadriatic as the deliverer
of Greek cities from the pirates of Illyricum. That
was in truth the first step in that eastward march
by which, five hundred and fifty years later, Rome
herself, in her own person, followed in the wake of
her dominion, and transferred her seat from the
seven hills by the Tiber to the seven hills by the
Bosporos. Or shall we say that the first step was
taken at a far earlier time? The position of Rome
as an Italian state, ruling over Greek allies and
subjects, but in return deeply affected by Greek
influences of every kind, had begun while Rome still
dwelled in her own peninsula. Before she crossed
the Hadriatic, she had begun to put on the character
of that compound power, politically Roman, intellectually
Greek, whose calling it was to leaven the
world. The extension which was marked, in the
later half of the third century, by the Roman
alliance with Apollônia, Epidamnos, and Korkyra,
was an extension only geographical. The ally or
mistress, whichever name we choose, of Naples,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Tarentum, and Syracuse, the undoubted mistress of
the greater half of Sicily, had already begun to put
on the character of a Greek power before she drew
sword for or against any city of the elder Greece.
Rome had entered the ranks of the <i>Hellênismos</i>
before Corinth admitted her citizens to strive in the
games of the Isthmos, before Athens honoured them
with initiation into the holiest rites of Dêmêtêr and
her Child.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a lecture of my former course I pointed out
some of the physical conditions which made it
possible for Rome to rise to the headship of the
world. The course of all history, I then ventured
to say, had been determined by the geological fact
that certain hills by the Tiber were lower and
nearer together than the other hills of Latium. If
I were lecturing on Roman history as such, instead
of taking a glance of a moment, a glance of a mere
thousand years or so, at Rome in her œcumenical
position, I might carry out this thought into great
detail. For my present purpose it is enough to say
that the central spot of the central peninsula was
naturally called to headship. We might point out
that the process which made Lugubalium and Nisibis
bulwarks of Rome began when the Palatine and the
Capitoline hills were girded by a single wall. But
it is enough for us to mark the great steps in the
advance of the Roman power, the steps which made
her the head of Latium, the head of Italy, the head
of the West, the head, and in the end the mistress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of the Mediterranean world. In all these stages we
must ever bear in mind that the rule of Rome was
in the fullest sense the rule of a city, a rule of
essentially the same kind as the rule of other ruling
cities before and after. It was distinguished from
the rule of Athens, Sparta, Carthage, Bern, and
Venice only by the vastness of the scale to which
the rule of the Roman city extended, and by the
process, unparalleled in the history of any other
city, by which the franchise of the ruling commonwealth
was gradually extended to all its allies and
subjects. Latium, Italy, the Mediterranean world,
were merged bit by bit, not only in the Roman
dominion but in the Roman city, till every Italian
ally, every Greek confederate, even every barbarian
provincial, had become a citizen of Rome. It is
true that the last stage of the process did not take
place till to be a citizen of Rome simply meant to
be a subject of Rome’s master. It has been doubted,
with no small show of reason, whether the edict
of Antoninus Caracalla was not an immediate loss
rather than an immediate gain to those whom it
admitted to the full honours of the Roman name.
But the eye of universal history looks at the change
in another light. The edict of Antoninus, whatever
its immediate motives, whatever its immediate results,
did in the end create an artificial Roman
nation throughout the Roman dominion, at any
rate from the Ocean to Mount Tauros. Every freeman
throughout the Empire had now a right in the
name and traditions of Rome. We see the results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of this change in the men of the fifth and sixth
centuries, in those Romans of Gaul and Spain who
knew no national name, no national being, save
that of the city to which their forefathers had
bowed. We see its yet more lasting results in the
Romans and the Romania of the East, in the Greek-speaking
folk from whom the Roman name has not
yet wholly passed away, in the Latin-speaking folk
to whom in our own day the Roman name has again
become the living badge of their regenerate being.</p>

<p>On Rome then, as head of Europe in a sense in
which no other among the powers of Europe ever
reached that headship, the two duties of a great
European power were laid in a fulness in which they
were never laid on any other. Rome was called on,
before all others, to be the teacher of nations of her
own European stock, to be the champion of Europe
against the inroads of barbarians from without. In
the former character her teaching had sometimes to
be sharp; she had often to wield the rod of as stern
a discipline as that with which Gideon taught the
men of Succoth. It was the mission of Rome to
make the Gaul the partaker of her tongue and culture.
It was her mission to make the Teuton the
heir of one half of her political power. She was to
frame out of his stores and her own a third state of
things distinct from either of the elements that went
to frame it. Of the union of Teuton and Roman
sprang the world of modern Europe. But for that
union the nations had to bide their time; as in the
games of Hellas, they that rose before the happy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
moment were scourged back again. They who came
as invaders only had to be dealt with as invaders
and not as disciples. The Gaul who came before
his time had his scourging at Sentinum; the Teuton
who came before his time had his scourging
at Aquæ Sextiæ and Vercellæ. But how well the
work was done with Gauls and Teutons who better
knew their time and place, we see when the Gaul
Sidonius paints in his Roman speech the portrait of
one Theodoric, Gothic lord of a Roman realm; we
see it when a greater Theodoric, Gothic lord of a
mightier Roman realm, legislates from his throne at
Ravenna for the welfare of Rome’s earliest Gaulish
province. Here was one side of the mission of the
head of Europe, the teacher of the kindred nations.
Her other side as European champion, as foremost
representative of the Eternal cause, stands forth in
her long warfare with the Carthaginian, the Persian,
the Arab, and the Turk. And both sides stand forth
together when Rome, lady of the nations, marches
forth with her Teutonic <i>comitatus</i> round her to meet
the hosts of Attila. The work was well in doing
when Anianus looked from the walls of Orleans on
the banners of deliverance, Roman and Gothic, flocking
side by side, in the strife when Roman, Goth,
and Frank, Catholic, Aryan, and heathen, joined to
deal the final blow for the common European soil on
the day of slaughter in the Catalaunian fields.</p>

<p>How the Latin city of Rome marched to the headship
of Latium, how the head of Latium marched to
the headship of Italy, are matters of Roman rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
than of universal history. The œcumenical calling
of Rome comes upon her as soon as she has become
the head of Italy, perhaps more strictly in the very
moment of her becoming such. She is not fully head
of Italy till she has beaten back the invader from
Epeiros from the shores of her peninsula. But her
war with Pyrrhos had brought her into the thick of
the Greek world and all its complications. Unless
we accept the tales of her earlier dealings with
Massalia, Rome has not yet sought either Greek
allies or Greek enemies beyond the bounds of Italy.
But Greece, in the person of her foremost champion,
had come to seek out Rome within those bounds.
The fight of Beneventum ruled that Italy should be
Italian; it ruled that no Greek power should arise
in Western Europe to balance the realms of Ptolemy
and Seleukos in the East. It ruled in short that the
head of Italy should be Rome. The wars which
Rome had waged against the Samnite and the Gaul
had made her beyond all comparison the first power
in Italy. The war with Pyrrhos, the war that
threatened to make Italy, like Asia or Egypt, part
of a Greek dominion, made her the undoubted head.</p>

<p>The head of Italy now stood forth as one of the
great powers of the world. It marks one of the
differences between the political state of those days
and that of our own that Rome had no sooner undoubtedly
risen to this position than she found herself
engaged in a struggle, a struggle well nigh for
life and death, with the other great power of the
Western Mediterranean. In the modern world, what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ever
jealousies, controversies, wars, may arise between
any of the great powers of Europe, none seeks
the utter destruction of any other, none seeks the
abiding weakening of any other, its degradation
from the rank of a great power. But the establishment
of Rome as the undoubted head of Italy, as
one of the two greatest powers of the West, at once
condemned her to abiding rivalry with the other
power, a rivalry which might be salved over by this
or that interval of peace, but which meant that,
sooner or later, either Rome or Carthage must perish.
We must remember that, while between any other
two of the great wars of Rome there was some slight
interval of peace, the war with Pyrrhos and the
Italian allies of Pyrrhos was followed without any
break whatever by the first war with Carthage.
That war was the War for Sicily. On any theory of
natural boundaries, a power that was the head of
Italy might reasonably, so far as there is reason in
such matters, expect to spread its dominion over the
lands within the Alps, and over the three great islands
which look like natural appendages to the peninsula
of Italy. And a power which spread itself over the
lands within the Alps, a power which from its own
shores could look out on the mountains of Illyricum,
could hardly expect to keep itself wholly unentangled
by the affairs of the lands on the other side of
Hadria. Rome then had hardly become the head of
Italy before two fields of action were opened for her
without a breathing-space. She had to strive with
the other great power of the West, and signs were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
not wanting that before long her destiny would call
her to mingle in the strifes of Eastern Europe also.</p>

<p>The Western call was the earlier and the nearer.
Close on the war with Pyrrhos followed the War for
Sicily, the war of more than twenty years waged
mainly on the waters by the fleets of Rome and
Carthage. As a war for Sicily, as one of the greatest
of the many wars for Sicily, it takes its place in the
long range of cycles which make up the history of
that illustrious island. Rome now for the first time
buckled on her harness to play her part in dealing
with the Eternal Question. Was the greatest of
Mediterranean islands to be a part of Europe or of
Africa, to be a possession of Aryan or of Semitic man,
to be the home of the gods of Alba and Olympos or
of the Moloch and Baalim of the men of Canaan?
The Greek had waged the warfare for ages; the
fates had gone against him; the realm of Hierôn was
but a small survival of the days when Sicily had
come so near to being a purely Hellenic island.
The calling for which Syracuse was too weak passed
on to the stronger hand of Rome. Panormos, won
for Europe for eleven hundred years, was no mean
first-fruits of the strife. After well nigh a generation
of warfare, Rome stood forth victorious, mistress
of Sicily, presently mistress of Sardinia and Corsica,
seized of her first provincial dominion, rich in the
faithful alliance of the first and worthiest of her long
line of dependent kings. The rival power came out
of the strife, not crushed, hardly weakened, but
driven to transfer her energies to a new sphere, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
seek in a new land the means of dealing a blow at
Rome in the heart of her own Italy.</p>

<p>The choice of that new sphere of Carthaginian
energy, the exploits of the house of Hamilkar, the
line of the sons of Thunder, of itself opens a new
and important, though as yet a secondary, page in
the history of Europe. The time has come for the
most western of her three peninsulas to play its
part in the general affairs of the world. But the
peninsula which was not wholly Mediterranean,
which had two of its three sides washed by the
outer Ocean, was never to play such a part as the
elder peninsulas which felt only the waters of the
inland sea. A day was to come in ages still far
distant when Spain should be a ruling power in
Italy and in Greece. But Spain never was to be
what Italy or what Greece had been, nor what Italy
was to be again. For several centuries her fate was
to be a great and flourishing dependency of Rome,
which, when it had once fully accepted the dependent
relation, was to be less disturbed either by
civil wars or by foreign invasion than any other
province of the West. And now her fate was a
strange one, but a fate which the wonderful cycles
of history brought back again after more than nine
hundred years. Spain was to be as Sicily. One
phase of the Eternal Question was twice to be
whether the most western land of Europe should
be a part of the Western or the Eastern world.
Rome had to win the land from the grasp of the
Phœnician; its own sons had in after ages to win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
it back from the grasp of the Saracen. For the
moment the third of the great peninsulas was to be
in turn the stronghold of either side, to be the
arsenal where Carthage first gathered up her strength
for the attempted overthrow of Rome, and where
Rome then gathered up her strength for the more
than attempted overthrow of Carthage.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Punic Wars form a kind of episode in the
history of Europe, just as the presence of a Punic
people in the Western Mediterranean is of itself an
anomaly and in some sort an episode. The existence
of the Carthaginian power hindered what we might
have looked on as the natural course of history for
the three great European peninsulas. When Rome
had become the undisputed head of Italy, the next
growth of her power might have been looked for
in the direction of the Gaul and of the Greek. The
headship of Italy had been won by driving back a
Greek invasion, an invasion from a Greek land within
sight of Italy, and that headship might be looked on
as imperfect till it was further spread over Sicily at
one end and Cisalpine Gaul at the other. Sicily was
at once fought for, and in the end won; but it had
to be won from the intruding Carthaginian. When
the first Punic War was over, the eyes of Rome were
again drawn beyond the Po and beyond the Hadriatic.
The conquest of Cisalpine Gaul was begun;
the Illyrian wars led to the first establishment of
Rome as an influence, as a power, in the Eastern
peninsula. Protector, mistress in all but name, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Korkyra, Epidamnos, and Apollônia, Rome has become
an element in the affairs of Greece herself as
well as in those of Greek colonies in Italy, Sicily,
Spain, and Gaul. She has won the jealousy of Macedonia,
the good will of the free states of Greece. That
is, she has taken the first steps towards bringing
Greek friends and Greek enemies alike, first under
her influence and then under her dominion.</p>

<p>If the first Punic War was in some sort an episode
in European history, a check in the expected march
of Rome, still more truly can this be said of the
second. The Hannibalian War stands out in the
history of the world as before all things a strife between
a man and a commonwealth, a strife between
the first of men and the first of commonwealths. Yet
if Hannibal overshadows Carthage, if Carthage seems
but an instrument in his hands, we must remember
that Hannibal has no being apart from Carthage, that
the work that he does is not the work of Hannibal
but the work of Carthage. Nor must we let the
glory of Hannibal altogether quench the glory of the
other members of his house. Rome had to strive
against a line of heroes, against the whole lion-brood
of the house of Barak. One son of Thunder came
after another; what the Grace of Baal began, the
Help of Baal came to strengthen. But in our swift
œcumenical survey we must be careful of tarrying to
do homage even to the greatest of individual men.
We have to deal with the results of their actions. The
object of the Hannibalian war was the humiliation,
the destruction, of Rome. Its effect was to raise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Rome higher than ever, to make her in one generation
the head of the whole West, before long to be the
head of the East also. It brought, as we have seen,
the western peninsula into the current of European
affairs; it brought it into that current as a stronghold
of Roman dominion; it made Rome a power out
of Europe; she came out of the struggle more than
ever the head of Italy, mistress of all Sicily, advancing
to be mistress of Spain, holding a commanding
influence in Africa. If she lost Cisalpine Gaul for a
season, it was only for a season; the work could be
done again, and Rome won an influence in Gaul beyond
the Alps which was presently to stand her in
good stead. From Eastern Europe her eyes are turned
away for a moment, to be turned thither again in
another moment with far more steadfastness. That
which, but for the check given to the course of things
by the great Hannibalian episode, we might have
looked for as the next scene of the drama, now
actually comes on the stage as an episode within the
episode. Under cover as it were of the war with
Hannibal, Rome for the first time wages war east
of the Hadriatic as the ally of one of the chief Greek
powers and as the enemy of another. But if that
first war between Rome and Macedonia looks like an
episode, if it seems trifling beside the great strife
with Hannibal, that was merely because the Macedonian
king failed to do what in reason he ought to
have done, if he went to war at all. The phalanx
and the siege-train of Philip failed to take their
place alongside of the horsemen and the elephants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Hannibal. Still the first Macedonian war marks a most
important stage in the advance of Rome towards the
East. Rome now for the first time measured herself
against the resources of a great kingdom, as in the
war with Carthage she for the first time measured
herself against the resources of a great commonwealth.
Rome, Carthage, and Macedonia were now the three
great powers of Europe, and Rome had to strive
against both the other two at once. It was well
indeed for Rome that Macedonia never put forth her
full strength while the strength of Carthage was still
unbroken. As it was, Hannibal alone, without allies
save the barbarians whom he gathered to his standard,
after the fearful losses of his Pyrenæan and his
Alpine march, was able to win every pitched battle
that he fought, and to bring Rome so near to destruction
that no power but Rome could have come alive
out of the trial.</p>

<p>Never in truth was the Eternal Question so near
to its solution, so near to a solution which might
have stifled the life of Europe for ever, as when
Hannibal debated in his mind whether he should
march straight from the field of Cannæ to the gates
of Rome. It was a moment like that when it rested
on the vote of the polemarch Kallimachos whether
the thousands of Athens should meet the tens of
thousands of Persia on the day of Marathôn. It is
not for us to say whether such a march would have
turned the destiny of the world for ever; it is
enough that all that formed the life of Europe, all
that was to form the life of Christendom, seemed at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
that moment to hang on the balance. The difficulty
is fully to take in that Hannibal and his kinsfolk,
the great house and the greatest of its sons, were
in truth fighting in the same cause as the mere
barbarian destroyers against whom the strife had to
be waged at other stages of the long tale. Yet so
it is; when we see Rome, with her citizens, colonists,
and allies, holding up against the mercenaries of
Carthage, when we contrast the votary of Jupiter
with the votary of Moloch, we shall soon see on
which side it was the abiding interests of mankind
truly lay. It was after all in the worthiest of
causes that the first of cities was pitted against the
first of men. The overthrow of Carthage enabled
Rome to go on to the overthrow of Greece; but if
Greece was to have a conqueror, it was well that
she should have a conqueror who could become a
disciple in a way such as the Phœnician never could
be. It is hard to name Hannibal along with Attila
or even with Abd-al-rahman, yet the day of Zama, or
rather the long endurance which made the day of
Zama possible, must be set down by the still abiding
world of Europe as a great salvation, a crowning
mercy, alongside of the work of Aetius and Theodoric
and the work of the elder Charles.</p>

<p>How it was that Rome and Europe lived through
such a trial, what were the special causes which
gave Rome strength to bear up through the most
fearful of dangers, it is for special historians of Rome
to tell. For us it is enough that Rome came forth out
of the struggle mistress of the West, with Carthage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
spared to live on for rather more than fifty years
as a Roman dependency. She was then to perish;
her land was to become a Roman province; she was
herself, after a hundred years of desolation, to rise
again as a Roman city, the head of one of the
greatest of Roman lands, the seat of a special and
abiding form of Roman life, a life of more than
seven hundred years, till the power of Rome in
Africa gave way to Semitic invaders more terrible
than the old Phœnician. The fight of Zama put an
end to the long and wonderful episode of Phœnician
power in the Western seas; it left Rome leisure to
go on with her work, as conqueror and teacher in
Western Europe, as conqueror and disciple beyond
Hadria. Whether if Philip had put forth the full
power of his kingdom and its allies, he and Hannibal
together could have overthrown Rome, it is a waste
of time to guess. It is enough for us to know and
to rejoice that so it was not; Philip failed to act
with Hannibal, and Rome could overthrow Hannibal
and Philip, each in his turn. The first Macedonian
war brought Rome into the thick of Greek affairs.
The Greek states learned all of a sudden what Rome
could be either as a friend or as an enemy. But they
were slow to learn how truly the relation of either
friend or enemy of Rome was only a step to the
relation, first of Roman dependent, and then of
Roman subject. They were not likely to learn the
lesson; neither princes nor commonwealths are ever
quick in learning such lessons. The Greeks of that
day no more dreamed what Roman interference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
meant than the Greeks of a hundred and fifty years
before had dreamed what Macedonian interference
meant. No prince or people ever does in such cases
fully understand what is coming. But, seeing Rome
had been on the whole the immediate loser in the first
Macedonian war, the Greeks of that day were still
less likely to see how vastly Rome was a gainer by
engaging in any Macedonian war at all. Men who
had grown up as leaders in the several Greek states,
who were used to look on Greece and the neighbouring
powers as forming a world of their own, a world
in which Roman interference was as little looked for
as interference from another planet, were not likely
to foresee the days that were to come before their
own lives were ended. Philopoimên dreamed not yet
of days when no Greek statesman dared to strike a
blow or speak a word without the good will of the
barbarian commonwealth which had become practically
the mistress of them all. That they did not
foresee those days was no special short-sightedness of
Greeks or of commonwealths; it was the common
short-sightedness of merely human statesmen, who
had not, like their critics, the means of profitting by
the experience of ages which were still unborn.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second century <small>B.C.</small> the
actual possessions of Rome were small indeed compared
with what they were at its ending. When
the century opened, Rome was the undoubted head of
the West; it was by no means clear that she was
ever to become head of the East as well. To rule that
so she was to be was the work of that all-important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
and neglected age. At its beginning, Rome was
head of Italy; she was winning back the dominion in
Cisalpine Gaul which the Hannibalian war had cost
her; but she had no provinces of her own separate
winning; she had only the lands in Sicily, Sardinia,
and Spain which she had taken over from Carthage,
lands which in Spain at least needed frequent hard
fighting to enlarge or even to keep. In Transalpine
Gaul she had as yet no possessions; Massalia was
still an independent and specially cherished ally.
In Africa Carthage was an unwilling dependency;
Massinissa of Numidia was a faithful and zealous
vassal king, to be favoured and strengthened as long
as Carthage was allowed to live. In Eastern Europe
Rome had indeed begun her dominion beyond Hadria,
a dominion as yet over allies and not over acknowledged
subjects. But it was a dominion which did
not stretch beyond certain points of coast immediately
opposite to the Italian peninsula. Rome had appeared
as a destroyer in more than one island and
city in the heart of Greece; but she had done her
work of havoc in fellowship with Greek allies, and, if
she had shown herself at all in Greek warfare, it was
only because Philip had chosen to be the ally of
Hannibal, but not to be his ally in such a sort as
to strike at Rome on her own ground. In the
further East Pergamon was already the ally of Rome;
Attalos and Eumenês were to be as Massinissa so long
as either Macedonia or the Seleukid power needed
watching on behalf of Rome. The Seleukid power
was as yet neither friend nor enemy; Egypt was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
bound to Rome by a friendship of some standing, but
friendship had not as yet brought dependence with it.</p>

<p>Let us look only twenty years later. Rome has
not increased her immediate territory on the eastern
mainland by a single district or city. But Kephallênia
and Zakynthos have joined the company of
Korkyra and Epidamnos; Aitôlia has entered the
formal relation of Roman dependence; Macedonia
has sunk to it as the penalty of warfare with Rome;
she has risen again to at least formal independence as
the reward of good service to the ruling commonwealth.
Beyond her small possessions in Western
Greece, Rome has in the Eastern world no dominion
but that of influence; but through that dominion
she is supreme. The vast dominion of Antiochos, the
Great King, successor alike of Cyrus and of Alexander,
has been cut short; driven back beyond Tauros, he
has almost withdrawn from the Hellenic world; the
lord of Asia, seeking for a moment to be lord of Europe,
has sunk to be lord only of Syria and of such lands east
of Syria as he can keep back from the grasp of the
encroaching Parthian. In his stead, royal Pergamon,
democratic Rhodes, a crowd of smaller powers, ready
to receive the bounty of Rome, have parted out the
solid peninsula of Asia among them. The Roman
Senate, which so lately sat to devise means by which
Rome might be saved from the grasp of Hannibal,
now sits as a Court of International Justice for the
whole civilized world, ready to hear the causes of
every king or commonwealth that has any plaint
against any other king or commonwealth, ready even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to bend its ear to the voice of every party, of every
man, that has any plaint against any other party or
any other man within the smallest commonwealth.
The Roman Fathers judge the causes of powers which
are in theory the equal allies of Rome; they judge
by virtue of no law, of no treaty; they judge because
the common instinct of mankind sees the one
universal judge in the one power which has strength
to enforce its judgements. When Rome speaks, all
obey; kings fall down at the threshold of the Senate-house,
as entering an assembly of gods; they keep
themselves humbly within the line that the Roman
rod traces round them, even on soil that they have
made their own. Rome in truth rules from the
Hadriatic to the Euphrates no less than from the
Ocean to the Hadriatic; but save in the old Roman
land which is her own, save in the few provinces
which she has taken over as part of the spoil of
Carthage, her power is still everywhere a power of
influence and nowhere of direct dominion.</p>

<p>The work of the hundred and fifty years which
were to pass before Rome came to obey the rule of a
single man was largely to change this power of influence
into a power of direct dominion, in a word to
change allied and dependent states into subject provinces.
Let us look again in the later years of that
same second century. Italy has extended herself, if
not in formal language, if not in legal right, yet in
the common speech of men, over all the lands within
the Alps. Gaul is now the land beyond the Alps
where Rome, now protector of Massalia, has won a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
mighty province, a province binding together Italy
and Spain, and keeping her old ally as it were in
ward. Spain has largely become a Roman land; it
has altogether become a Roman possession, save only
those mountain districts which so many conquerors,
each in turn, have found it so hard to conquer.
Africa is a province; Carthage is a wilderness;
Numidia and Mauretania are helpless dependencies.
East of the Hadriatic, not a few lands and cities,
Athens, Sparta, Rhodes, Byzantium, the wise confederates
of Lykia, still keep their formal independence.
But direct dominion has widely advanced; if not
as yet actually the rule, yet it is the fate which has
overwhelmed the greatest powers; the kingdom of
Macedonia is now the province of Macedonia; the
kingdom of Pergamon, so lately enlarged out of
Seleukid spoils, is now the province of Asia; Achaia,
with Corinth lying waste, is, whether formally a province
or not, at least so utterly dependent as to make
the question as to its political state a question
merely formal. Syria, Egypt, all the kingdoms of
Asia, must count as vassals of Rome. If absolute
freedom lives on anywhere in the Mediterranean
world, it is where freedom is the shame of Rome
rather than her glory; the independence which Rhodes
and Athens keep but in name is kept in all its
fulness by the pirates of Crete and the pirates of
Kilikia.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the headship of Rome was won over Italy and
the Mediterranean world. A dominion had grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
up of which mankind had never seen the like. No
king of kings had ever come so near to universal rule
as this city of cities. And now, in the last years of
the second century and the early years of the first,
came the question whether Rome could keep what
she had won, the question, we might almost say,
whether Rome could keep her own independent being.
New powers arose to dispute her claim to be head of
the West, to be head of the East, to be head of her
own Italy. Gaius Marius came down from his car of
triumph over Jugurtha, to march, in a new consulship,
in new consulships crowded one upon another,
to save Gaul, to save Italy, to save Rome herself,
from the attacks of Teutonic invaders who had
come before their time. Small are the remains that
Aquæ Sextiæ can show to remind us of that great
deliverance; yet we look up to the Mount of
Victory, and feel that it was in the fates that the
bones of our kinsfolk should fence in Massaliot vineyards;
the day was not yet come for Gothia and
Romania to be freely yoked together in the happy
bride-ale of Narbonne. The day of Aquæ Sextiæ, the
day of the Raudian fields, confirmed Roman headship
in the West for five hundred years. It needed a
longer struggle with Eastern powers strengthened
by the arts of Greece&mdash;when Greece and Asia, allies
and subjects, were goaded to revolt by the misdeeds
of the ruling city&mdash;to secure Roman headship in the
East, not for five hundred years only, but for thrice
that time. And nearer still, on her own soil, at her
own gates, within her own future walls, Rome had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
again to fight for life and death against Italian enemies.
Another Pontius had come from the Samnite hills to
root up the wood that sheltered the wolves of Italy.
It needed the happy star of Lucius Sulla, it needed
the last eager prayer of the Felix, the Epaphroditos, to
the angered gods of Greece, to keep in being, not
merely the lordship over Gaul and Asia, but the very
life of Rome as one Italian city on her own hills.</p>

<p>Yet vain indeed was the struggle of Cimbri and
Teutones, of Marsian and Samnite, of the Pontic
king and his allies in Asia and in Europe. Rome
came forth from her threefold trial the undoubted
mistress of all. On no corner of Mediterranean soil
was there any power left that could really dispute
her will. The first century before and after our æra
sufficed to gather in the spoil. Enemies and allies,
independent and dependent, were to be changed into
subjects; kingdoms were to sink to provinces; and,
if some cities once more than sceptred still kept the
forms of freedom, yet chains did in truth clank over
them when the Senate and People of an independent
commonwealth dared only to pass such decrees as
might suit the pleasure of the nearest proconsul.
Of Rome’s two great rival leaders, one was to spread
her dominion to the Euphrates, the other to the
Channel and the Northern Sea. The Syria of Gnæus
Pompeius became Rome’s richest province; but the
land of old Damascus and younger Antioch could
never become a Roman land. The Gaul of Gaius
Cæsar became a Roman land indeed, the abiding
home of Roman life and Roman culture, the land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that had the praises of its cities sung by Ausonius of
Bordeaux and its whole life painted for us in full by
the pencil of Sidonius of Auvergne. And above all
things the possession of Syria and Gaul gave Rome
a new position and laid on her new duties. One
aspect of the second century before our æra is that
the barbarian powers of the East are again threatening.
The work of Alexander and Seleukos seems
half undone. Rome had weakened the arms of their
successors without taking their calling on her own
shoulders. As it was with the pirates, so it was with
the Parthians; so it was even with the barbarians to
the north of Macedonia. During the time when the
Greek commonwealths and kingdoms had ceased to be
really independent, but when they had not yet formally
sunk to the state of Roman provinces, neither of these
frontiers of the civilized world was effectually guarded.
The second century before Christ was therefore a
great age of barbarian advance. Again, as Mommsen
puts it, the world had two lords. A power grew up
on the eastern border, before which the Macedonian
kings of Syria gave way, and against which Rome
herself could do little more than hold her own. That
Sulla was the first Roman who had direct dealings
with the Parthians marks the course of things.
Parthia was waxing mighty while Rome was weakening
the kingdoms which might have checked the
growth of Parthia. The new barbarian power lived
for three hundred years after Sulla’s day to be the
equal rival of Rome, in whose strife with Rome both
sides could boast of victories and momentary con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>quests,
while neither could boast of any lasting
weakening of its rival. And a day came when the
Parthians, who had come within the range of Greek
influences, whose kings boasted themselves as
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: philellênes]">φιλέλληνες</span>,
had to give way to more vigorous champions of
the Asiatic side in the Eternal Question. In a long
rivalry of four hundred years, the regenerate Persian,
strong in his national life and national religion,
remained Rome’s truest and worthiest rival. Again
each power felt the might of the other on its borders;
what Galerius won Jovian had to give back. At last,
when the great blow was coming on both alike, each
sent forth as it were its own Hannibal to strike at
the vitals of the enemy. Chosroes encamped within
sight of Constantinople; Heraclius gave law to the
Persian in the heart of his own realm. One might
be curious to know how this great side of the world’s
history looks in the eyes of those who draw the
mystic line at the patriciate of Odowakar. Julian to
be sure comes before the line; but the writings which
record the deeds of Julian are a sealed book&mdash;unclassical,
I believe, not of the golden or even of the silver
age. As for Belisarius and Heraclius, they doubtless
pass, either in East or West, for Greeks of the Lower
Empire, as cowardly and effete as all their fellows.</p>

<p>But the growth of the Parthian power, continued,
as far as universal history is concerned, in the power
of the regenerate Persian, is after all only one aspect
of a chain of events which was then already ancient
and which still abides. It did but put the Eternal
Question under new conditions and give either side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
new and stronger champions. Meanwhile in vast
regions of the West, in one memorable corner of the
East, conditions arose which were absolutely new.
Pompeius, conqueror of Syria, caused the lands of
Rome to march upon the Parthian; Cæsar, conqueror
of Gaul, caused the lands of Rome to march upon the
German. One gave her a neighbour who could be
only an abiding rival; the other gave her a neighbour
who would not be a subject, but who was, in the fulness
of his time, to enter on his twofold calling
as conqueror and disciple. And now our own history
begins, the history of the Teutonic race in its three
great homes, in the European mainland, in the great
island of the Ocean, in the vaster mainland beyond
the Ocean. I need tell no one here that in Cæsar’s day,
in days ages after Cæsar, the history of ourselves, as
distinguished from the history of our future home, is
to be sought for, not by the Thames and the Severn,
but by the Rhine and the Weser. We have not very
long to wait before one line of Tacitus will reveal the
existence of the Angle, before one line of Ptolemy will
reveal the existence of the Saxon. But as yet we
stand undistinguished among the mass of our brethren.
Whatever is theirs is ours also. We have our part in
the great deliverance by the wood of Teutoburg;
Arminius, “liberator Germaniæ,” is but the first of
a roll which goes on to Hampden and to Washington.
By Rhine and Danube Rome at last found her Terminus;
to extend it to Elbe or Eider was not for
Drusus or Germanicus, but for the first Teuton who
wore her crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The conquests of Cæsar then, by making the
Roman and the German neighbours, neighbours whose
presence could not fail to work the deepest impress
on each other, opened one side of later history. The
world that then was, the world of Roman dominion
tempered by Greek influences, had now nations beside
it which were neither subjects nor as yet rivals, nations
whose mingling with that elder world, in many forms
and at many stages, was to call into being the world
in which we live. But the Roman and Teutonic
elements out of which the world of modern Europe
and European colonies was to be formed, were not the
Roman and the Teuton in the first state in which
history shows them. Their fusion did not come till
both had been brought under a common influence.
And that was an influence whose birthplace carries us
back again from the conquests of Cæsar to the conquests
of Pompeius, from the conquests of Pompeius
to an earlier stage of the Seleukid power. When that
power was weakened on the great day of Magnêsia,
its weakness was not merely to open the way for the
advance of Parthia from the East. Native powers,
held down under Persian and Macedonian supremacy,
sprang into new life. The greatest of existing Semitic
powers had been humbled; it was soon to be wiped
out; but the abiding life of the Semitic race showed
itself in new shapes, in one shape that was doomed to
be more abiding than the power of Sidon and Carthage.
That shape of Semitic influence was to intertwine itself
so closely with the power of Rome that the two could
never more be rent asunder. Arab lords of Damascus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
gave a foretaste of the days when mightier Arab lords
of Damascus should reign from the Indus to the Ocean.
Hebrew lords of Jerusalem called up the memory of
the days when mightier Hebrew lords of Jerusalem
had reigned from the river to the Great Sea westward.
Hannibal might die in banishment; his city might
become heaps like older Nineveh; but men speaking
the tongue of Hannibal, though they worshipped not
the gods of Hannibal, were, from the day when
the holy zeal of Mattathias struck down the renegade,
to form one of the great moving powers in all future
history. If the Greek was to enlighten the world, if
the Roman was to rule the world, if the Teuton was
to be the common disciple and missionary of both, it
was from the Hebrew that all were to learn the things
that belong to another world. In the highest teaching
of all, Roman and Goth had to become the disciples
of the Jew, but of the Jew speaking only by the
mouth of a Greek interpreter. Before the Aryan
world of Europe could truly do its work, it had to
take to itself a Semitic creed. It had to take to itself
that Semitic creed so fully, so exclusively, as to make
it by adoption the creed of Europe, to make it before
all things the creed of Rome. For the last twelve
hundred years the Eternal Question has taken the
shape of an abiding strife between two creeds alike
of Semitic birth. But of those two creeds one has
become Aryan by adoption; the younger races accepted
the gift which the elder cast aside; as the
birthright of Edom passed to Israel, so the birthright
of Israel passed to be the common heritage of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Greek, the Roman, and the Teuton. Rome is not
Rome in all her fulness, she has not risen to the true
height of her mission in the world, she is not fully
mistress and teacher of the nations, till she has cast
aside her old gods and has bowed to the spiritual
mastery of a despised sect from a despised corner of
her dominion. The miracle of miracles, greater than
dried-up seas and cloven rocks, greater than the dead
rising again to life, was when the Augustus on his
throne, Pontiff of the gods of Rome, himself a god to
the subjects of Rome, bent himself to become the
worshipper of a crucified provincial of his Empire.
The conversion of our own folk, the conversion of any
other barbarian folk of Europe, was no marvel. Where
Rome led, all must follow, Celt, Teuton, Slave, each
in his turn. That Christianity should become the religion
of the Roman Empire is the miracle of history;
but that it did so become is the leading fact of all
history from that day onwards. Explain the fact
as we will, Christianity is the religion of the Roman
Empire, and it is hardly more. It has been accepted
by every land which either became part of the Empire
or came under its influence; that is, it has become
the creed of Europe and European colonies. Beyond
those limits it has made conquests, but they have
seldom been abiding; such cases as Abyssinia are
exceptional, and after all they come of Roman influence
more widely spread than usual. Christianity
has never been the creed of any great power beyond
the European world. The great nations of Asia and
Africa have either kept their ancient heathendom or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
have become more distinctly antagonistic to the faith
of Rome by embracing the faith of Arabia. On the
other hand, no nation within the Roman pale can be
said to have fallen away from Christendom. The folk
of Christian lands have been enslaved or swept away;
renegades have been many; whole tribes, as in Albania,
have become apostates, but whole nations never. It
would have sounded strange in the ears of Nero or of
Trajan to be told that a day would come when the
rule of Rome could be spoken of as the joint “rule of
Christ and Cæsar;” to be told that their successors
should be admitted to their office by rites borrowed
from the sacred books of the Hebrew, at the hands of
the chief of the sect whose votaries they sent to the
lions or to the coat of fire. It was in a very deep and
living sense that the words were fulfilled which said
that the kingdoms of the world had become the
kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ. But their
highest fulfilment of all was when the Empire of the
Cæsar came to rejoice in its Christian style of Holy;
when the Emperor, Advocate of the Universal Church,
deemed it a further honour to wear the garb and to
share in the office of Christian priesthood; when
Dante gave his genius to show that the growth of the
Roman power was the special work of God, and that
the head of the Roman power was, in all things
earthly, God’s immediate Vicar upon earth. A theory,
it may be said, which no age saw in practice. Truly
so, and chiefly because the power of Rome split
asunder, because the inheritance of her Cæsar was
disputed between a prince by the Bosporos and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
prince by the Rhine. Those days are still far from
us; we shall reach them in the course of our story;
it is enough here to say that the very cleaving to
Roman titles and traditions on the part of powers from
which all that was truly Roman had passed away was
in truth the most speaking witness to the deep and
lasting impress on men’s minds which had been
won for the teaching that it was for Rome, and for
Rome alone, to rule and judge the nations.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The change from the commonwealth to the Empire
of Rome was in truth a gradual process by which
a single citizen of Rome, charged with a special
commission, allowed to unite offices and powers which
were designed to act as checks on one another,
changed, step by step, first into a practical, and
then into an acknowledged, master of Rome and of
all that obeyed Rome. That change, so strikingly
analogous to the gradual process by which Rome
herself changed from influence to dominion, is, in our
œcumenical survey, of far less direct moment than it
is in the constitutional history of Rome herself. We
have to deal with the œcumenical headship of Rome,
whatever form the government of Rome herself may
take. But the indirect œcumenical results of the
change from commonwealth to Empire were vast
indeed. To the Roman city the change was political
death; to the provinces it was the beginning of a new
life. Under the Empire, not only were many practical
grievances lessened in the subject lands, but the
process of fusion between the subject lands and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
ruling city went on with far greater speed than it
could go on as long as the Roman city was engaged
in the vain task of striving to unite <i>libertas</i> at home
with <i>imperium</i> in other lands. The <i>Imperator</i> came
because the <i>imperium</i> was there to call for him, because
for the subject lands one master was less grievous
than many. It was not without good reason that the
provincials raised their altars to more than one prince
for whom the citizens, also not without good reason,
sharpened their daggers. Under the Empire, families,
cities, whole lands among the provinces, were admitted,
one by one, to the full rights of Romans. At
last the decree went forth of which we have already
spoken, the decree which gave to all of them the rights,
or at least the name, of Romans. From that day,
most fully in the West, more fully perhaps than we
fancy even in the East, an artificial nation grew up,
a nation with its blood mingled with the blood of
every stock in Europe, but a nation Roman in name,
Roman in feeling, Roman in culture, and, with the exception
of the merest survivals, Roman in speech.
Before the days of Teutonic migration began, Rome
had done her work in the West. Gaul and Spain
were lands no less Roman than Italy. If the Roman
of Gaul was not always eager to fight for Cæsar, so
neither was the Roman of Italy; but the Roman of
Gaul was as little inclined as the Roman of Italy
either to join the barbarians or to set up for himself.
I speak of the lands as wholes; the special fortunes of
Britain and of a corner of Armorica we may have
other occasions to think over. If the world of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
was to run its destined course, it was needful that
the lands into which the Teutonic conquerors of the
mainland were to make their way should be thoroughly
Roman lands, lands where the invaders would find
that fully developed Roman culture which was needful
for the future of mankind. The work could not
have been done if the lands into which the Goth and
the Burgundian entered had been still Iberian and
Celtic instead of Roman. The process of making
them Roman was carried on more swiftly, steadily, and
thoroughly under the Empire than it could ever have
been under the commonwealth. In this way, without
sharing the fashionable admiration for successful
crime, without joining in the base and shallow sneers
which even great scholars have stooped to hurl at
patriots whose worth soars above their moral level,
we can still see that the overthrow of the freedom of
the Roman city was a needful step in the progress
of the Roman world. It was one stage towards that
wedding of Gothia and Romania the offspring of
which is the world in which we live.</p>

  <h2>LECTURE III.<br />
  ROME AND THE NEW NATIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span>
have seen Rome rise, step by step, to the
headship of Latium, the headship of the West, the
headship of the Mediterranean world. At most
stages of her course her progress has been slow;
at one stage only does she rise to a new position
as in a moment. That is when, having been checked
on her Eastern course by the Hannibalian war, the
city that had overthrown the Eastern masters of the
West sprang at once to the headship of the Eastern
as well as of the Western world. The power which
had trodden under foot the sons of Thunder was
entitled to take its next step with the swiftness of
the thunderbolt. But, once head of the Eastern
Mediterranean, with her Senate once established as
judge in all causes from the Hadriatic to the Euphrates,
Rome was in no hurry to exchange her rule
of influence for a rule of acknowledged dominion. Indeed,
if her later hankering after provinces had begun
sooner, it may be that she would have better checked
the advance of the lords of Parthia and Pontos. As
it was, it was by slow degrees indeed that cities and
kingdoms which long kept a nominal freedom were
formally brought within the grasp of her universal
sovereignty. And as the forms of her <i>imperium</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
grew up only by slow degrees, so the forms of her
<i>libertas</i> died out only by slow degrees. Slowly and
stealthily did Rome march to the acknowledged
sovereignty of her own world; slowly and stealthily
did the citizen whom Rome placed at the head of
her commonwealth march to the acknowledged sovereignty
of Rome herself and her subject lands. It
was almost at the same moment that the power of
the <i>Imperator</i> and his army finally supplanted the
power of the Prince, the Senate and the People, and
that all the free inhabitants of the Roman world
were admitted to the rank of Romans. That is, they
became equal subjects of the <i>Imperator</i>, while each
man among them who could wield his sword with
skill and good luck gained the chance of becoming
<i>Imperator</i> himself. The artificial Roman nation, the
<i>Romani</i> of the West, the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span>
of the East, was
now called into being. By the next step the master
of that nation avowed his mastery. The diadem of
Jovius and Herculius, the proud style of the Lords
of All, the bendings of the knee, the whole ceremonial
which surrounded the new Augusti, were a
contrast indeed to the simple pre-eminence of the
first of citizens, the highest of magistrates, to whom
that sacred name was first decreed. Chief of a
Roman nation, Roman alike on the Euphrates and
on the Ocean, the Emperor was in no sort bound to
the local Rome by the Tiber. Shall we say that
Rome had been swallowed up in Romania, or more
truly that all Romania had become Rome? Emperors
were now as much at home at Nikomêdeia and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Antioch, at Milan and Ravenna, at York and Trier
and Arles and the true Vienna by the Rhone as they
had once been in the modest <i>regia</i> of the elder Rome
or in its prouder Septizonium. No wonder that in
after years Emperors were found no less at home at
Ingelheim and Aachen and Gelnhausen, at Nikaia and
Thessalonica and Skoupi, and in the false Vienna by
the Danube. But the chosen servant of Jove on his
throne at Nikomêdeia did but open the way for changes
vaster still. A man born in Illyricum, raised to
power in Britain, schooled in Gaul in the arts of
empire, won Rome by his right hand, but only to transplant
the very life of Rome to a more abiding seat of
power. Diocletian, first of the avowed lords of the
Roman world, had not slept for many years in his
mausoleum at Spalato before a New Rome had arisen
by the Bosporos, before the temples of a new worship
on the hill of the Vatican and in the palace of
the Laterani had begun to threaten the dominion of
Jupiter Optimus Maximus on his own Capitol.</p>

<p>The New Rome, the Rome of Constantine, the
city of Constantine, the city of Emperors, the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileuousa]">βασιλεύουσα</span>
of the Greek, the <i>Tzarigrad</i> of the Slave,&mdash;more
proudly still, simply the City,
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: hê polis]">ἡ πόλις</span>, the
name that survives in the <i>Stamboul</i> of her alien
lords&mdash;was a city Christian from its birth. The
Rome of Romulus remained for a while more pagan
than any city of the Empire, save Athens alone. In
its new seat meanwhile the Empire was Holy from
the beginning. The great question of the divided
Empire did not present itself till ages later. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
days to come men disputed which was the true
Augustus; was it he who received his unction
among the columns of Saint Peter in the Old Rome
or he who received it beneath the dome of the Divine
Wisdom in the New? As yet the oil of the Old
Covenant had not been poured on any Imperial head;
and though two or three Augusti might reign side
by side, the Empire was not held to be thereby
divided. Yet a certain pre-eminence came by a kind
of natural selection to the Emperors who reigned in
the Eastern seat of Empire. In the days of transition,
the true middle ages, the days when Roman
and Teuton stood side by side, ready to be fused,
but not yet fused, into the compound being of the
modern world, every cause, every accident, tended in
every way to make the Eastern Rome the truest and
most abiding representative, not indeed of Rome’s
moral influence, but of Rome’s abiding power.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When did the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire begin? The clear instinct of Gibbon carried
on his tale to the fall of its Eastern branch; the
formal fall of its Western branch he lived not to see.
In our point of view the ages of the so-called decline
of the Empire are the ages of its greatest influence;
the political decline of Rome, the moment when her
strength directly as a power began to fail, might
perhaps be placed a little earlier than the date
chosen by that great master of us all whose immortal
tale none of us can hope to displace. Under Trajan
the Empire reached its greatest territorial extent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
But we may stop and ask whether conquests like
his were not in some sense a sign of coming weakness.
The second century of our æra opens with
Trajan’s momentary glories; before that century is
ended, the day of real conquest is past. Marcus
keeps his watch by the Danube with other objects
than those with which Drusus had kept his watch
by the Rhine. The work of a Roman prince is now,
not to press the Roman Terminus forward, but to
keep him from falling back. The days of victories
and triumphs, the days of conquest in the territorial
sense, are still far from being past; but from Marcus
to Stilicho, we might say from Marcus to Belisarius
and Heraclius, to Nikêphoros and John Tzimiskês, to
the Palaiologos who won back Constantinople and
the Palaiologos who won back Peloponnêsos, conquest
commonly meant simply the recovery of a dominion
which had once been held and which had fallen
away. We may apply the rule which we applied
in our first lecture. When the Greek had to drive
back the Persian from Greek soil, when the Roman
had to drive back the German from Roman soil, it
was a sign that the greatest days of each people, as
far as greatness of territorial dominion is concerned,
had passed away.</p>

<p>But, as in the Greek case, so in the Roman, the
very decline of territorial dominion marked the
beginning of a newly extended moral influence.
By the days of Marcus the two great elements of
the world that was making already stood face to
face. The tables were now turned; the German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
was the invader; the Roman stood on his defence.
Again and again was the German driven back from
the soil of Gaul and even from the soil of Italy.
Presently days came when he could no longer be
driven back, days when it was oftentimes wiser to
welcome him on Roman soil, as the subject, the ally,
the soldier of the Empire, taught to guard the borders
of the Empire against brethren who came on the
same errand as himself. Warlike Emperors won
triumphs at the head of Teutonic armies; unwarlike
Emperors sent forth commanders of Teutonic
blood to win triumphs for them. At the bidding
of such commanders Emperors were made and unmade;
men of Teutonic birth became consuls, patricians,
guardians of Imperial sons-in-law; one prize
alone was forbidden; the diadem itself was not as
yet to rest on a Teutonic brow. And if the sovereignty
of Rome remained in Roman hands, so it
was in one quarter alone, the quarter in which she
had seemed to make the greatest advance, that the
territorial extent of the dominion of Rome was
formally cut short. The Asiatic conquests of Trajan
had passed away almost with Trajan’s self; his
European conquest, his vast Dacian province, last
to be won and first to pass away, was given up by a
soldier of Rome hardly less illustrious than himself.
Aurelian made the Danube once more the Roman
frontier; beyond it the Goth might dwell till his
day came to march at will through the three great
peninsulas and at last to find himself a throne in the
most western. But for a hundred and fifty years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
after the surrender of Dacia, fully up to the end of
the fourth century, we can hardly say that the
borders of the Empire ever formally went back. The
Empire contained crowds of Teutonic settlers; we
can hardly say that it as yet contained any Teutonic
settlements. Whoever dwelled within the Roman
frontier was either, in name at least, a subject or
soldier of Cæsar, or else he was an enemy marching
to and fro in a foreign land. The Franks already
dwelled in their distant corner of Gaul; but they
dwelled there as soldiers of the Empire, charged
with the duty, which, if they sometimes betrayed,
they sometimes loyally discharged, of keeping the
frontier of Rome against new comers. The Goth
himself, marching hither and thither through Greek,
Italian, and Gaulish lands, holding Rome herself to
ransom, keeping at last his jubilee of plunder within
her walls, was not always the formal foe of her
princes; at one moment he accepted honours and
commands from the lawful Augustus; at another
he made himself the friend and soldier of the Empire
by setting up an Emperor of his own. Alaric himself,
in all his marches, all his sieges, never found
abiding rest for the sole of his foot; he never became
the acknowledged territorial master of a single
inch of Roman soil. But before he had gone to rest
in his grave beneath the waters, before the Gothic
trumpet was heard at the Salarian gate, before he
entered by the same path by which Brennus had
entered well nigh eight hundred years before, the
path from which Hannibal had turned away, the path<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
on which Pontius of Telesia had dealt the last blow
for free and disunited Italy, before that day of fear
and wonder in the annals alike of the waning and of
the rising power, another act in the great drama had
begun. Other Teutonic settlers had begun to establish
themselves as abiding dwellers on Roman soil,
and the Goth was presently to follow in their steps.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are now landed in the fifth century of our
æra, the century which beheld the earliest germs
of the nations of modern Europe. It is the age
which, more than any other, answers to the third
and second centuries before our æra. They answer
to one another, because the later period, to a great
degree, reverses the work of the earlier. The former
period made the Roman Empire; the latter went far
to unmake it. Never, till the days of its gradual
dying out, did it come so near, in the Western lands
at least, to being broken in pieces. We might say
in truth that in the West the Empire was broken
in pieces in the fifth century, but that it was largely
put together again in the sixth by a reaction from
the East. For the first aspect of that age is that
which has been already pointed out, the fact that, while
the political power of Rome is thus shivered in the
West, in the East it maintains itself, to some extent
even enlarges itself. The Eastern division of the
Empire, the lot of the successors of Arcadius, is
that which really kept up the unbroken political
traditions of Rome. It has its wars and its
revolutions, its settings up and puttings down of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Emperors; it even sees the marching to and fro of
Teutonic armies. But all seems mild compared with
the turmoil of the West. The war with the Persian,
ended at last by an honourable peace which abides
for a hundred years, is another matter from the
endless struggle with the German on every frontier.
The occasional revolts at Constantinople do not
begin till the second half of the century, and they
pass for nothing alongside of the series of tyrants
and momentary Emperors which disturbed the West
during nearly the whole time. The Eastern throne
was so far the firmer that the West was over and
over again willing to accept an Emperor of his
Eastern colleague’s choosing. Above all, the Eastern
provinces were not parted out among Teutonic
rulers. The Eastern movements of Alaric hardly
reach into the fifth century, and the marchings to
and fro of the two Theodorics at a later time were
a trifle compared with the great invasions which
parted out the West into Teutonic kingdoms. It is
these which are the real work of the fifth century.
At its beginning, the Empire, with the boundaries
of Valentinian hardly touched, is divided between
the sons of Theodosius as Imperial colleagues. At
its end, a single Emperor reigns at Constantinople;
but the whole West, with Rome itself, has
fallen away from his practical dominion, and the
greater part has passed from even his nominal
supremacy. The power of Rome lives on only in
those Eastern lands into which she made her way
when her power in the West was assured by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
weakening of the power of Carthage. She has lost
the fruits of the fights of Metaurus and of Zama,
of the leaguer of New Carthage and the leaguer
of Syracuse; she keeps the fruits of the day of
Kynoskephalai and the day of Pydna, the day of
Thermopylai and the day of Magnêsia. The genius
of Rome, banished from his elder seat by the Tiber,
is watching from his newer seat by the Bosporos
till the old home can be won back again.</p>

<p>The two ages which we have thus casually
brought together, the age in which the East was
won for Rome and the age in which the West fell
away from Rome, supply, as has been already hinted,
some most instructive points of comparison and contrast.
The two ages may be compared and contrasted
from two points of view, one as regards the breaking
up of the Roman power, the other as regards the
formation of the Teutonic powers which so largely
took its place. We may compare the way in which
the Roman power was formed and the way in which
it fell in pieces. We may also compare the way in
which the Roman power was formed and the way
in which the powers were formed which took its
place. We will begin with the former comparison,
with the analogy, as a political study, between the
way in which the power of Rome came together and
the way in which it split asunder. As that power
emphatically was not made but grew, so, no less emphatically,
it was not abolished but died out. That
is of course in those lands where, as in Gaul and in
the greater part of Spain, it can be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
ever died out. In any land that came under the power
of Rome, that power was established step by step;
so in any land that fell away from the power of
Rome, that power vanished away step by step. The
intermediate state between complete independence
and complete subjection, the various stages of alliance
and dependence, play a great part alike in
the work of welding together and in the work of
splitting asunder. Rome has again her allied and
vassal kings, in some cases even her allied and
vassal commonwealths. They passed from subjection
to complete independence by the same path by
which they had passed from independence to complete
subjection. But in such cases it makes a wide
difference in which direction men’s faces are turned.
The formal relation may be the same; the real
position is different. In the elder case alliance is
a decent name for subjection which the time has
not yet come to press to the extreme point. In the
later case alliance is a decent name for independence
which the time has not yet come formally to acknowledge.
Hierôn, Massinissa, Eumenês, Prousias,
were kings in alliance with Rome; so were Alaric,
Ataulf, Odowakar, perhaps Chlodowig himself. Two
things mark the difference between the ally who is
marching towards subjection and the ally who is
marching towards perfect independence. The ally
of old dwells outside the acknowledged Roman dominions;
his land is destined to be one day a part
of them, but it is not so as yet. If he receives
titles and honours from Rome, they are the titles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
kingship in his own realm. A consulship of Hierôn,
an army of Roman citizens or Italian allies marching
under the command of Massinissa, would have seemed
strange indeed. The ally of the later day dwells
within the Roman dominion; he receives certain
Roman lands by the tenure of defending Roman
lands generally against fresh invaders. Already
king of his own people, he adds to the titles of
barbarian kingship the titles of Roman civil or
military office; he is consul, patrician, <i>magister
militum</i>. Above all, the ally of old, weaker ally
of a stronger power, never draws his sword against
his mightier ally, unless indeed, in some wild moment
of hope or of despair, he seeks to win back the
independence which he finds that he has lost, and
thereby only hastens his subjection. The ally of
the later day, in very truth stronger ally of a
weaker power, freely draws his sword against the
lord whom he professes to serve, whenever so to do
seems the readiest way to win from him new grants
and honours. The contrast is marked indeed; yet
the analogy is clear also. Rome did not win her
provinces by suddenly annexing lands which were
wholly independent; she did not lose her provinces
by having them suddenly torn away from her substance
to form at once some wholly separate power.
In both cases the same formally intermediate stage
was gone through, the stage of alliance, dependence,
vassalage, whatever name we choose to give to it. It
was step by step that the world became Roman; it
was step by step that it ceased to be so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>And it is a striking thought that, as far as we can
see, the two processes, of absorption in the Roman
body and of separation from the Roman body, were
actually going on at the same time. I have hinted
at this already. It is certain, and it is one of the
facts in all history which makes us most pause and
think, that the work of incorporation of Greek states
into the Roman body which began beyond Hadria in
the later days of the third century before Christ and
which had begun long before in Italy and Sicily, was
by no means over in the fifth century after Christ. The
history of Cherson alone shows it. That distant and
long-lived outpost of Greece and ally of Rome cannot
be looked on as fully passing from alliance into
subjection till the ninth century had run a good part
of its course. The work which began when Korkyra,
Apollônia, and Epidamnos became Roman allies was
not ended till the Roman power was divided for
ever, and till a Frank Cæsar reigned in the West.
The geographical position of Cherson secured her
a practical freedom; to bring her into bondage would
have needed an exertion of the full power of the
Empire. But the relation which Cherson could really
keep was for ages the formal relation of a crowd of
cities whose liberties could be at any moment trampled
under foot by the nearest proconsul. When were all
these free cities, whose rights Trajan respected, each a
little San Marino with the Roman Empire surrounding
it, formally annexed to that Empire? Or were they
ever formally annexed at all? Can any man tell
the last day of that Athenian commonwealth which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
numbered Hadrian among its archons and Constantine
among its generals? What if the Senate and
People of Athens still went on in their old home after
Honorius had striven to gather together at Arles
something like a Senate and People of Southern
Gaul? Most likely there is no date to be fixed
in this and in a crowd of other cases. The old forms,
the old feelings, died out so gradually that it would
be impossible to say when the dependent commonwealth
finally changed into the municipal town.
When Theodoric was putting out edicts for Goths
and Romans in Italy, Greek Senates and assemblies
in Asia may still have been passing decrees in ancient
form. One thing is plain; when Justinian shut up
the University of Athens, the General, successor of
Periklês, who acted as its Chancellor, must have found
the more part of his duties slip away from him.</p>

<p>But if the fifth century was for the Roman power
a time of dying out or of splitting asunder, for the
Teutonic settlers in the Roman lands it was beyond all
other ages the time of birth and growth. And here
comes in our other side of comparison and contrast.
The process of Roman conquest in the East, if it has
very many points of unlikeness to the process of Teutonic
conquest in the West, has also some points of
likeness. In each case a less cultured people made
a political conquest of a people more advanced than
themselves. And in neither case did the conquest carry
with it any great destruction or displacement of the
older inhabitants, or any sweeping away of their laws,
customs, or language. A new people came in and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
set up some new laws and customs alongside of the
old. Only in the Roman case we can hardly say
that a new people did come in. Many Romans
dwelled, for public or private ends, in Greece and
Asia; some doubtless even settled there; but there
was not, even in Roman colonies like Corinth, any real
Roman settlement like the Teutonic settlements in
Gaul, Spain, and Africa. Still in both cases the conquered
led captive the conquerors. The Greek East
received a certain Roman infusion, but it remained
Greek. The Roman West received a far greater
Teutonic infusion; but, on two sides at least, those
of religion and language, it remained Roman.</p>

<p>In other words, the Roman conquest of the Greek
East, being unaccompanied by any real settlement in
the conquered lands, did not lead to the growth of a
new nation. The Greek nation, in the sense in which
we long ago defined it, the artificial Greek nation
which grew out of Greek colonization and Macedonian
conquest, passed, through the stages of dependence
and subjection, to the citizenship of Rome, such as
the citizenship of Rome had then become. From that
day the Greek was entitled to the Roman name, and
a time at last came when Greek and Roman came to
mean the same, when the Greek was the only surviving
political representative of the Roman name.
But the name
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaios]">Ῥωμαῖος</span>
on the lips of a Greek never expressed
the same real change which was expressed by
the name <i>Romanus</i> on the lips of a Gaul. Its meaning
was purely political. The Greek, heir of the most
perfect form of human speech, never cast aside that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
speech for what he deemed the barbarous dialect of
his conqueror; he did but admit a crowd of Latin
technical terms into his official language, witnesses
each of them that Greek had again supplanted Latin as
the official language of the Roman Empire of the East.
The Gaul meanwhile could not indeed exchange his
Celtic forefathers for old patricians or plebeians of
the Roman hills; but in everything short of actual
blood he became as thoroughly Roman as if he had
come of the stock of Fabii or Licinii. He spoke the
tongue, he adopted the ways, of Rome; long after
the thought of Roman nationality in any political
sense had passed away, when he had long learned to
acquiesce in the dominion of his Frankish conqueror,
when Rome and what clave to her had become to
him a foreign power, the Frankish conqueror was still
as much in his eyes the barbarian and himself the
Roman as when Chlodowig went forth to battle with
Syagrius.</p>

<p>We have said that it was the fifth century which
beheld the first germs of the nations of modern
Europe. We ruled that, if modern history must have
a definite beginning, the most convenient beginning
for it is the great Teutonic invasion of Gaul in the year
407. Yet the nations of modern Europe do not spring
from the nations which then crossed the Rhine, or
from any intermixture between them and the Romans
into whose land they made their way. The nations
which then crossed the Rhine were the Vandals,
Suevians, and Alans. Who were the Alans, who play
a great part in Spain for a moment and a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
part in Gaul for a somewhat longer time? Most
likely they were not Teutonic at all in their origin,
but had been more or less Teutonized by long contact
with Teutonic nations. There may be a few
drops of Alan blood in the mixed nationalities of
Gaul and Spain; but the Alan assuredly forms no
abiding or visible element in those lands; the nation
passes away from history before the fifth century
is over. Neither did their undoubtedly Teutonic
comrades, Vandal and Suevian, found any abiding
settlements in Gaul, or contribute any visible element
to the nationality of France, Aquitaine, or Burgundy.
In fact none of these nations made any real settlements
in Gaul; Gaul was to them simply the high road
to Spain. There they did settle, though the Vandals
soon forsook their settlement, and the Alans were soon
rooted out of theirs. The Suevian kept his ground
for a far longer time; we may, if we please, look on
him as the Teutonic forefather of Leon, while we look
on the Goth as the Teutonic forefather of Castile.
Here we have touched one of the great national
names of history; the Goth, like the Frank, plays
quite another part in Western Europe from the Alan,
the Suevian, and the Vandal. And yet he has not
played the same part as the Frank. Several lands
in Europe have at one time or another borne the
name of <i>Gothia</i>&mdash;I trust none needs the warning that
they are to be looked for in Gaul and Spain, or far
away in Crim Tartary, not in the islands or on the
mainland of the Baltic. But no land has kept that
name down to modern times. But two lands, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
two fragments of one greater land, still keep the name
of <i>Francia</i>, and the Frankish name, with the natural
changes on modern lips, has become the name of one
of the foremost of modern nations.</p>

<p>Now both Franks and Goths had passed into the
Empire long before the invasion of 407. One branch
of the Franks, as we have already hinted, was
actually settled on Roman lands, and, as Roman
subjects, they did their best to withstand the great
invasion. What then makes that invasion so marked
an epoch? It may be argued that the nations which
took a part in it are not those which play any great
and abiding part in European history&mdash;the Vandals,
great for a season, are isolated, and are great only for
a season; the great and abiding part is played by
the nations which were in the Empire before they
came. The answer is that the invasion of 407 not
only brought in new elements, but put the existing
elements into new relations to one another. Franks
and Goths put on a new character and begin a new
life. The Burgundians pass into Gaul, not as a
road to Spain, but as a land in which to find many
homes. They press down to the south-eastern corner
of the land, while the Frank no longer keeps himself
in his north-eastern corner, while in the south-west
the Goth is settled as for a while the liegeman of
Cæsar, and in the north-west a continental Britain
springs into being. Here in truth are some of the
chiefest elements of the modern world, and though
none of them are among the nations that crossed
the Rhine in 407, yet the new position taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by all of them is the direct consequence of that
crossing.</p>

<p>In this way, in Gaul and Spain at least, the joint
Vandal, Alan, and Suevian invasion is the beginning
of the formation of the modern nations, though the
invading nations themselves form no element in the
later life of Gaul and only a secondary element in the
later life of Spain. The later life of these lands, and
that of Italy also, has sprung of the settlement of
Teutonic nations in a Roman land, and of the mutual
influences which Roman and Teuton have had on
one another. Roman and Teuton lived side by side,
and out of their living side by side has gradually
sprung up a third thing different from either, a
thing which we cannot call either Roman or Teutonic,
or more truly a thing which we may call Roman
and Teutonic and some other things as well, according
to the side of it which we look at. This third
thing is the Romance element in modern Europe,
the Romance nations and their Romance tongues.
Their birth, perhaps rather the appearance of their
first germs, comes in the fifth century; we do not see
them in their fulness till ages afterwards; but it is
then that the causes out of which they sprang began
to work. Unluckily it is hard to find a land in
which the elements of the fifth century have been
allowed to run their natural course undisturbed to
this day. Italy had no chance. Had not the system of
Theodoric been violently broken up, first by the Imperial
reconquest, then by the Lombard invasion, Italy
might have supplied the best of all studies of the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
in which a Romance people with a Romance speech
might grow up on the very soil of Rome herself.
Spain supplied a more hopeful field; the position of
the country hindered later Teutonic settlements; but
the Saracen conqueror came before West-Goth and
Roman had been thoroughly fused into one people.
Hence came the distinctive character of Spanish history,
the history of a people whose national life was
formed by the need laid upon them of daily working
out the Eternal Question in its sternest shape.
Northern Gaul, unlike Spain and Italy, lay open to
continued reinforcements of the Teutonic element
within it. <i>Francia</i> was an unbroken land lying far
away on both sides of the Rhine, and the division
into <i>Austria</i> and <i>Neustria</i> forestalls the later division
into <i>Francia Teutonica</i> and <i>Francia Latina</i>. The
rise to power of the Austrasian Mayors was almost as
much a Teutonic conquest of a Latin land as had
been the first conquest by Chlodowig, and the settlement
of the Normans in the tenth century brought
in another Teutonic element in one part of the land.
France then, in the narrower sense of that name,
differs from Spain and Italy in the presence of these
later Teutonic elements; but in Aquitaine and Provence
they had little force; it is there, rather than
anywhere else, that the normal result of the movements
of the fifth century may be best studied. In
the modern world of all, where those South-Gaulish
lands have helped to make up the great nation of
modern France, it is undoubtedly in that French
nation that we can best study the threefold elements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of a Romance people. The præ-Roman, the Roman, the
Teutonic, elements are all there; the whole, as a
whole, is none of the three, but the result of their
fusion; but the whole, looked at from special sides
only, may well be called by any name of the three.
The blood must be mainly Celtic&mdash;in the south
Iberian and Ligurian&mdash;but with some Roman and
some Teutonic infusion. The speech is Latin, but with
a larger Teutonic infusion than would be thought at
first sight. The political history is that of a Teutonic
kingdom, but a kingdom modified by planting its
Teutonic kingship among the Latin-speaking folk of
an originally Celtic land. The elements are fused
into a whole; yet they still stand side by side; we
cannot say that the Frank assimilated the Roman or
that the Roman assimilated the Frank. The Frank
learned the speech of the Roman; but in learning it
he modified it, and he gave it his own name. The
modern Frenchman is neither Roman nor Frank; he is
rather the outcome of the settlement of the two in a
land in which elements earlier than either have not
been without their influence on both.</p>

<p>The mention of the earlier elements in Gaul, elements
earlier than either Roman or Teuton, suggests
yet another analogy between the age in which the
Roman power was formed and the age in which it was
broken in pieces. The Roman was so far from displacing
the Greek tongue or Greek life, wherever he
found them really established, that he became in
some sort, not only their disciple, but their missionary.
Wherever the Roman went, he carried some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
measure of Greek influences with him. The Roman
conquest of Asia continued that work of hellenizing
Asia which the Macedonian conquest had begun. It
did much to root up elements older than Greek; it
made the solid Asiatic peninsula, the special Romania
of later times, into a land where in later times the
Turk has come in on his errand of destruction, but
where all that he has spared is still Greek. As the
Roman did this work in the East, so the Teuton did
a kindred work in the West; as the Roman everywhere
carried Greece with him, so the Teuton everywhere
carried Rome with him; his coming gave the
finishing stroke to the rooting out of all elements
older than the Roman conquest. Here and there
old tongues and old beliefs had lingered till his
coming; but for them he had not even those feeble
traces of reverence which may have still lived on in
the mind of a Roman of Gaul. He gladly learned
the tongue of the Roman; he never learned the
tongue of the Celt or the Iberian; he gladly bowed
to the God whom Rome had learned to worship;
nothing drew him either to the elder gods of Rome
or to the gods elder still who were worshipped before
the Roman came. In two corners only, special circumstances,
taking the shape of a distinct reaction,
allowed the elder races and tongues to put on a
new life. The Gascon north of the Pyrenees and
the Briton south of the Channel rose again, when
elsewhere all kindred vestiges were dying out, to
form each one a folk which has lived on to our
own day as a survival of days, not only before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Chlodowig and Ataulf, but before Gaius Julius and
Gaius Sextius.</p>

<p>So grew up the new nations in the Western lands of
Rome, the fruit in some sort, we may say, of the union
of Gothia and Romania. But there were other nations
which did not spring of that union, nations which
kept their untouched Teutonic being, nations which
still dwelled beyond the Empire, which within some
small parts of the Empire settled in another sort from
the Goth and the Burgundian nations. So it was in
the island which we won, not from the Roman but
from the Briton; so it was in the lands by Rhine and
Danube, where our kinsfolk conquered almost in the
same sort as we did. Yet even on lands and nations
like these the influence of Rome was deep and abiding.
Step by step they embraced the faith of Rome; and,
without casting away their own tongues, they adopted
the tongue of Rome as the tongue of learning and
religion. So it was in Germany and Scandinavia;
so it was in all the lands whose religion and culture
came from Germany;&mdash;with the Slaves of the North-West
who came within the world of the Western
Cæsar and the Western Pontiff, even with the
intruding Magyar whose coming split asunder the
great Slavonic mass, and left the Pole and the Wend
to look to the elder Rome, while the Serb and the
Russian looked to the younger. But the great conquest&mdash;only
which side was the conqueror?&mdash;was
nearer home. It was another partnership between
Gothia and Romania, though of quite another kind
from that which was meant to come of the bride-ale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of Narbonne, when Rome and Germany fused together
their political being, and the Western Empire of
Rome became the Holy Roman Empire of the German
Nation.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our general survey of the fifth century in the
West, we have passed but lightly over the most
striking event of its earlier years, the taking of the
Roman city by the Goth. Before the century was
out, Rome had become used to capture and plunder.
Gaiseric and Ricimer had harried her more fiercely
than ever Alaric had done. As an event, as an
incident, none in the whole history of the world was
ever fitted to make a deeper impression on men’s
minds than the first Teutonic capture of Rome. For
the purposes of the preacher and the moralist it
was all that the preachers and moralists of the time
painted it. But on the actual course of events it
had little effect. And why? Because the world had
so largely become Rome that the momentary woes
of the city which had once alone been Rome were
of comparatively little moment. The invasion of
Italy by Alaric led indirectly to those invasions of
Gaul and Spain which laid the foundations of the
modern world; but his actual sack of Rome had no
effect on the busy series of revolutions which followed
on those invasions. So it was with that
other event of the later half of the century in which
so many have so strangely seen the end of the
Roman Empire, the boundary line between ancient
and modern history. It was doubtless an impressive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
fact, we see in the annals of the time that it was
an impressive fact, when Emperors ceased to reign
either at Rome or at Ravenna. But as the news
that the Roman Empire had come to an end would
have sounded very strange at Constantinople, so it
would have sounded no less strange at Soissons or
at Salona. It did not greatly touch the Roman
realm of Syagrius in northern Gaul that Italy had
acknowledged Zeno as sole Emperor, and that he
was represented in the Italian diocese by the
patrician Odowakar. That those decent formalities
veiled a revolution by which the reigning Emperor
had been set aside by a chief of barbarian mercenaries
was nothing new or wonderful. The only
difference between the revolution of 476 and a crowd
of earlier revolutions was that Odowakar found that
it suited his purpose to acknowledge the nominal
superiority of an absent sovereign rather than to reign
in the name of a present puppet of his own creation.
Presently it was found convenient at Constantinople
to brand the patrician as a tyrant, and to grant a new
commission to another Teutonic leader to displace him
and to rule in his stead. The personal greatness of
Theodoric overshadowed Emperor and Empire; from
his palace at Ravenna, by one title or another, by
direct dominion, as guardian, as elder kinsman, as
representative of the Roman power, as head by
natural selection of the whole Teutonic world, he
ruled over all the western lands save one; and even
to the conquering Frank he could say, Thus far
shalt thou come and no further. In true majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
such a position was more than Imperial; moreover
there was nothing in the rule of Theodoric which
touched the Roman life of Italy. What might have
happened if the East-Gothic power in Italy had been
as lasting as the Frankish power in Gaul, or even as
the West-Gothic power in Spain, it is vain to guess.
As far as we can see, it was the very greatness of
Theodoric which kept his power from being lasting.
Like so many other of the very greatest of men, he
set on foot a system which he himself could work, but
which none but himself could work. He sought to
set up a kingdom of Goths and Romans, under
which the two nations should live side by side,
distinct but friendly, each keeping its own law and
doing its own work. And for one life-time the thing
was done. Theodoric could keep the whole fabric
of Roman life untouched, with the Goth standing
by as an armed protector. He could, as he said,
leave to the Roman consul the honours of government
and take for the Gothic king only the toils.
Smaller men neither could nor would do this, and
even a succession of Theodorics could hardly have
kept on for generations the peculiar relations between
Goths and Romans which he established.
His rule was the best, as that of the Franks was
about the worst, to be found in Roman and Teutonic
Europe in his day. Still fusion between Roman and
Teuton was the very essence of Frankish rule;
under the system of Theodoric no direct step towards
fusion could be taken. It was the necessary result
of his position that he gave Italy one generation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of peace and prosperity such as has no fellow for
ages on either side of it, but that, when he was
gone, a fabric which had no foundation but his
personal qualities broke down with a crash. Then
came the two events of the sixth century at which
we have already glanced. Italy was wasted by a
long and bloody war, which in the end swept the
East-Gothic people from the earth, and for a moment
left the Roman Augustus undisputed master
of every corner of the Italian peninsula. Then,
before the land had rested from the long struggle,
came another Teutonic invasion, the invasion of a
people far less touched by Roman teaching than
the Goths had been. The Lombards, establishing
their rule and their name in the two ends of Italy,
never won the whole of Italy. They never reigned
in Rome; it was only in the last days of their
power that they reigned in Ravenna. Throughout
the land, if there was a bit of Lombardy here, there
was a bit of untouched Romania there, and if the
Roman Terminus often fell back, he also sometimes
went forward. Even after the Lombard had yielded
to the Frank, after the Frank had taken on himself
the titles and mission of the Roman, a large part of
Southern Italy, the once Greek land, with the old
Greek life which had never wholly died out kept
up and strengthened, acknowledged the lordship,
not of the German-speaking Augustus of the Old
Rome, but of the Greek-speaking Augustus of the
New.</p>

<p>Of the Empire itself, its unions, its divisions, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
general position which it kept in the world, I shall
speak in another lecture. My present subject is
the influence of Rome on the new nations which in
the course of the fifth century found themselves
homes within her borders. And that practically
means her influence on the Teutonic nations of the
Western European mainland. It is true that the
greatest Teutonic migration of all, the long marches
of the Goths, Eastern and Western, began in the
East. While Vandals, Burgundians, Franks, came in
by way of Rhine, the Goths came in by way of
Danube. Their course in the Danubian lands forms
one of the most striking pieces of the history of the
fourth century and one of the most confused pieces
of the history of the fifth. But that history of the
Goths which really affected the world, the history
both of the West-Goths of Alaric and of the East-Goths
of Theodoric, was wrought in the West. The
Western Goths, as their name implies, came before the
Eastern and found homes further to the West. And
after the withdrawal of Theodoric and the East-Goths
from the Eastern provinces, those provinces which
still remained under the immediate rule of the
Emperors at the New Rome, all part of the first
Teutonic invaders in the history of the Eastern
peninsula may be said to come to an end. In that
peninsula they had been hardly more than invaders;
they had formed no important abiding settlement.
For them the Eastern lands were mainly a road to
Italy and Spain and Gaul. The part which the
Teutons played in the West was to be played in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
East, so far as it was to be played at all, by quite
another branch of the Aryan stock.</p>

<p>I have often had to point out the analogy between
the position of the Teutonic settlers in the West and
that of the Slavonic settlers in the East. The East,
mainly the South-East, of Europe is the true field
for Slavonic growth. Of the Slaves of the North-West
we have already spoken a word or two, as
coming within the range of the dominion and the
creed of the Western Rome. The North-Western
Slaves have been largely exterminated or assimilated
by Teutonic conquerors; even those who escaped
this lot have passed, by their union with the Latin
Church, into the general group of the nations of
Western Europe. The historic calling of the Slavonic
nations lies in the East, within the range of the
Eastern Empire and the Eastern Church. There we
may make our comparison between their position
towards that side of the Roman world and the
position of the Teutons towards its Western side.
The analogy between the two is real and strong;
but it is an analogy which presents almost as many
points of contrast as of likeness. In the phrase that
I have so often had to use, the Slaves were to the
Eastern lands of Rome, as the Teutons were to the
Western, at once conquerors and disciples. But they
were neither conquerors nor disciples in exactly the
same sense. The difference largely turned on the
different positions of the Old and the New Rome.
In the West, the more deeply Roman influences took
root, the less did the city of Rome show itself as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
seat of actual rule, till the days came when it
became the seat of an œcumenical rule of another
kind. From the third century to the nineteenth,
Rome never was the abiding dwelling-place of Emperors;
wherever they dwelled, they were, as far as
the local Rome was concerned, non-resident. The
influence of Rome, the use of the Roman language,
had nothing to do with any political boundary; it
was only here and there, in the Exarchate and in
the Imperial possessions in Spain, that there was
any distinct geographical frontier between Roman
and Teutonic rule. The possession of the Roman
city did not necessarily carry with it any special
dominion in other Roman lands, and a great dominion
in other Roman lands might be won without its possession.
With the Eastern Rome it was far otherwise;
there the city was the life and soul and centre
of all. The too discerning eye of its founder had
planted his New Rome at the junction of two worlds,
to prolong the being of successive powers which, save
for its possession, might sooner have passed away.
Constantinople was never without an Emperor
dwelling within its walls, and holding a greater
or less extent of territory in fact as well as in
name. His boundaries might fluctuate; the position
of this or that land might fluctuate. In the
process of constant warfare along a long and ill-defined
boundary, this or that land or city might
sometimes be under the undisputed authority of
the Emperor; it might sometimes be absolutely cut
off from the Empire and form part of a barbarian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
kingdom; it might sometimes be in the intermediate
state of a dependency over which the Emperor held
an outward superiority which he could enforce
or not according to circumstances. All this has
its like in the West; but there is nothing in
the West like the firm abiding of the Imperial
power at Constantinople. Whatever was the extent
or the nature of the dominion of the Eastern
Emperor, the Eastern Rome was its local centre,
the spot to which every corner of that dominion
looked as its head. No Slavonic host harried the
Eastern Rome as so many Teutonic hosts harried
the Western. No king of a Slavonic people received
an Imperial crown in Saint Sophia, as so many kings
of a Teutonic people received an Imperial crown in
Saint Peter’s. The utmost that such a king could
do was to set up a Tzarigrad of his own, to wear
a crown which he loved to call Imperial at Ochrida
or at Skoupi. The Slave became in many things a
disciple of the Eastern Rome, but in some things he
was perhaps an imitator rather than a disciple. He
always remained an outsider, in a way in which
the Teuton did not remain in the West. In religious
worship, above all, he never adopted either of the
tongues of the Empire; he could become a disciple
without becoming a subject. No new speech, no new
nationality, arose in the East out of a mixture of
Slavonic and Roman or Greek elements, answering
to the formation of the Romance tongues and nations
of the West. One cause, as we shall hereafter see,
was that the Eastern Rome spoke with two tongues,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
while the Western Rome spoke with one only.
There is a Romance nation in the East, but the
Slave was not one of its component elements; the
Slavonic invasion in short did not a little to hinder
its growth. On many of these points I may have
to speak again. The main business of the present
lecture lies in the West, in the Western lands of the
European mainland. Yet we must not forget that
the birth of our own nation, the settlement of our
forefathers in our second home, came within the
bounds of the same century which saw Burgundian,
Gothic, and Frankish kingdoms arise in Gaul. But
we, in our island home, our <i>alter orbis</i>, stood largely
aloof from the revolutions of the mainland. Our own
tale must be told separately, and it cannot be told in
all its fulness till the revolutions of the mainland are
fully understood. To-day we have had to deal with
the settlements of our kinsfolk in the continental
provinces of the West. At the East we have simply
glanced. We shall have to speak of it more fully
when we come to speak of the causes which split
East and West apart for ever.</p>

  THE DIVIDED EMPIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
most renowned of my predecessors in this
chair, in planning that History of Rome which unhappily
remained a fragment, but which gave to the
world in its last finished volume the very perfection
of historical narrative, designed to carry on his work
to the coronation of Charles the Great. The reading
and thought of forty years have ever more and more
convinced me of the wisdom of Arnold’s choice. The
year 800 was not, any more than the year 476, the
end of the Roman Empire; it is not, any more
than the year 476, a boundary between “Ancient”
and “Modern” History. But it is one of the most
marked turning-points in the history of the Empire
and of the world, a turning-point of immeasureably
greater moment than the consulship of Basiliscus and
Armatus. The election of the first Charles changed
the face of the world far more than the deposition
of the last Romulus. Of a History of Rome such as
Arnold planned, it was, as the wise instinct of Arnold
saw, the fitting ending. The election of Charles
did, in outward show, restore the Old Rome to her
old position. She again became, if not the dwelling-place,
at least the crowning-place, of Emperors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
In truth the Old Rome had never before beheld the
ancient Hebrew rite which, from the fifth century
onwards, had become familiar in the New. For a
thousand years longer the titles of her Empire went
on; for seven hundred years longer they could be
won only before the altar of the Vatican basilica.
For full five hundred years longer the Roman Empire
of the West was, as such, a living thing, a thing that
influenced the minds and acts of men, a mighty fact, a
still mightier theory. But in the West the Emperor of
the Romans had less and less to do with the Old Rome.
To his Imperial capital he gradually became a stranger,
and his capital became a city of strangers to him. In
short, the Roman power in the West altogether passed
away, not only from the Roman city, but from the artificial
Roman nation. When Rome again asserted her
right to choose her sovereign, she chose, she could not
fail to choose, a man who was not Roman even by
adoption. She chose the Frankish king. Pippin had
been Patrician; so had Ricimer; so had Odowakar.
But the son of Pippin bore a loftier style. The long-abiding
tradition was broken through; a barbarian
received the diadem; the Roman Pontiff spoke the
words, and the Roman people echoed them&mdash;“Karolo
Augusto, a Deo coronato, magno et pacifico Romanorum
Imperatori, vita et victoria.” The German was at
last Augustus. No greater witness could there be to
the moral conquest which each race had won over the
other. The Empire now in form received its greatest
territorial enlargement. Gaul was won back and Germany
was added. Wherever the Frankish king had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
before ruled as king, he now ruled as Emperor.
Terminus advanced to the Elbe and the Eider; he
was ready to advance to the Oder and the Vistula,
or, if need should be, to the world’s end. All unreal,
all nominal, some objector will cry; an advance, not
of Rome, but of Germany, an advance, not of the
Roman Augustus, but of the Frankish king. And
truly the Empire of Charles, much more the Empire
of the Henries and Fredericks, was unreal in this,
that it was assuredly a very different thing from
the Empire of Trajan or of Diocletian. It was assuredly
not Roman in the sense in which the Empire
even of Theodosius was Roman. But here lies the
greatest proof of the influence of Rome, of her magic
power over the minds of men, that a power which
had practically ceased to be Roman, should still be
Roman in men’s eyes, and, as Roman, should command
a reverence, a devotion, a bowing down as it were of
the whole soul, which could be called forth by no
other name. A name may have lost its first meaning;
but, as long as men will fight and die for the name,
the name is a fact indeed.</p>

<p>The act of 800, it must always be borne in mind,
was in one sense the repetition, in another sense the
undoing, of the act of 476; but it was in no case the
revival of the line of Emperors which came to an
end in 476. Charles, Emperor of the Romans, was
not the successor after a long interval either of Romulus
Augustulus or of Julius Nepos; he was the
immediate successor of Constantine the Sixth. The
Emperors had lost all practical authority in Rome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
earlier in the century; their power had passed to the
Frank. Charles Augustus received no powers which
he had not already exercised as Patrician; only
hitherto the titles of sovereignty had been left to the
Emperor beyond the sea. The name now went with
the reality; the titles and badges of Empire were
transferred to the new Emperor reigning at Rome, at
least crowned and anointed at Rome. There was no
need to depose any reigning sovereign. Rome had
acknowledged Constantine; she refused to acknowledge
Eirênê; the Empire could not be held by a
woman, least of all by a woman who had deposed
and blinded her own son. There was again an interregnum,
such as had followed the death of Romulus
and the death of Aurelian; that interregnum was
ended by the election of Charles. In Western theory
no doubt, Charles himself, and each of his successors,
was elected to the sovereignty of the whole Empire;
he was to reign, if he could, over the New Rome as
well as over the Old. In Eastern theory no doubt the
election and coronation were null and void; the Emperor
anointed in Saint Sophia had a right which
none could take away to reign over the Old Rome as
well as over the New. Each Emperor in short asserted
himself to be the one true Emperor and the other to
be an impostor or a tyrant. The dispute was for
some centuries stirred up afresh from time to time at
some moment favourable for its discussion. To men
zealous for Eastern rights the Western claimant was
a mere
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Alamanôn rhêx]">Ἀλαμανῶν ῥήξ</span>;
to men zealous for Western
rights the Eastern claimant was nothing loftier than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
“Rex Græciæ.” The most curious piece of discussion
on the subject is the memorable controversy, waged
by or invented for Basil of the East and Lewis of the
West, while the grounds of the dispute were still
fresh. It was a moment of pride for Charles the
Great himself when Nikêphoros waived his claim
to universal rule, when he admitted the Frankish
king as his equal and bade his ambassadors adore
him as <i>Imperator</i> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span>.
A conflict of claims
like this, in which each of the two greatest princes
of Christendom gave himself out to be the one
head of Christendom, might have been expected to
lead to something more than constant disputes and
jealousies; it might have been expected to lead to
constant wars. As a matter of fact, formal wars
between the two Empires were not common; there
was little to gain by them on either side. But rivalry
and ill-feeling went on between the princes of the
West and of the East, between the men of the West
and of the East, to the great damage of Christendom
in more than one hour of need.</p>

<p>The truest view of the event of 800 is that the
existing Empire was split asunder, and that the
western fragment, that which acknowledged the
Frankish king as its Emperor, was in form enlarged
by the addition of the territories of the Frankish king.
The Empire was now really split asunder; it was
split asunder between two rivals, each of whom held
himself to be the one lawful representative of their
common predecessors. This state of things must not
be confounded with the state of things in the fifth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
century. The Empire was now divided in quite
another way from that in which it had been divided
between the sons of Theodosius. The division between
the sons of Theodosius did not differ in form
from the division between the sons of Constantine or
the earlier division between Diocletian and Maximian.
The division between Arcadius and Honorius, and
the Emperors who followed them in the fifth century,
was a division by consent; the administration of a
single Empire was divided, as it had often been before,
between two Imperial colleagues. But now it
was divided between two rival potentates, each of
whom was in theory bound to deny the rights of the
other. Then the West was often willing to accept
the prince named by the Emperor who reigned over
the East; now assuredly no prince named by the
lord of Constantinople, the “rex Græciæ,” would
have been admitted to royal and imperial unction
at Aachen, at Milan, and at Rome. But mark
further that the Western division, the Western
Empire, was not only parted from the Eastern, but
was enlarged by the addition of new territories, over
a great part of which no Emperor had ever reigned
before. If Charles had kept his Frankish and Lombard
kingdoms distinct from his Roman Empire, the last
would have consisted only of Rome and Ravenna and
the lands about those cities. No one so well deserved
the somewhat grotesque title of his later successors,
“zu allen Zeiten Mehrer des Reichs,” as the first
Emperor who could have understood his own description
in any Teutonic tongue. Charles, as I said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
earlier in these lectures, annexed the lands which
Drusus and Germanicus had failed to annex. But to
what did he annex them? Assuredly to something
very different from the Empire of the first Augustus,
to something very different from that western half
of the Empire of Augustus which had been reigned
over by Maximian and Valentinian. And the effect of
the annexation was widely different from what it
would have been if it had been made either by
Drusus or by Valentinian. The main difference lies
in this, that whatever was annexed to the Empire
at either of the earlier times was forthwith added to
the artificial Roman nation that was growing up,
while the inclusion of the whole dominions of Charles
within the Empire, though it still carried with it
an extension of Roman influences, in no way carried
with it any extension of an artificial Roman nation.
The new subjects of the Roman Empire, the inhabitants
of Gaul and Germany, assuredly did not
feel that they had become Romans. The election
of Charles to the Empire, the annexation of all his
dominions to the Empire, did far more to make
the Empire German than it did to make Germany
Roman. The Roman style of the Empire is still
very much more than a name; its Roman traditions
are still very much more than mere words; it is still
by its abiding Roman character that it keeps its
influence over the minds of men. But it is now
altogether divorced from any practical connexion
with the Roman city and with the Roman nation.
It was nothing new that Emperors should be made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
elsewhere than in Rome; that discovery was made
before the first century of the Empire ended. But the
Emperors so made were Romans, Roman in speech,
Roman at one stage by real citizenship, at another
by artificial nationality. It was something new that
Rome should be the crowning-place, and only the
crowning-place, of Emperors who were Roman in
no sense but that of being Roman Emperors. The
Emperor was <i>Romanorum Imperator</i> to the last; but
who were the <i>Romani</i>? Were they the inhabitants
of the Empire as a body? The mass of them
would assuredly have disclaimed the Roman name.
Or had the name fallen back on its elder and narrower
senses in which it meant only the people of
the Roman city? But in Rome itself the authority of
the Roman Emperor passed away more thoroughly and
more formally than elsewhere. The <i>Imperator</i> and
the <i>Pontifex Maximus</i> had long ceased to be the same,
and in Rome the <i>Pontifex Maximus</i> of the new faith
had become the true local sovereign. For ages the
<i>Imperator</i> came to Rome only to become <i>Imperator</i>,
and then to go away. At last, when the succession
begun by Charles was drawing near its thousandth
year, an <i>Imperator electus</i> came to Rome, and went
away without winning the right to cast aside his
qualifying adjective.</p>

<p>The truest description of the Western Empire
during the thousand years from the first Charles
to the last Francis is that which sounds so like
a contradiction, “the Holy Roman Empire of the
German Nation.” It remained by the strictest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
continuity a Roman Empire; once accept the position
of the Western Emperors as against the Eastern,
and no flaw can be found in the whole succession.
But the Roman Empire had become a possession
of the German nation; German electors chose a
German king, and the German king had a right
to receive his consecration as Roman Emperor without
any further questions being asked.</p>

<p class="noindent">An older form of the same idea is found in the
phrase which spoke of the translation of the Empire
from the Greeks to the Franks. Translated to the
Franks, the Empire, as concerns the West, assuredly
was; and, on the Western theory, it may in a sense
be said to be translated from the Greeks. A line
of Emperors whose native speech was German succeeded,
in Western ideas, a line of Emperors whose
native speech was Greek. Yet the phrase will not
stand every test. The words “Greek” and “Frank,”
as used in the formula, do not exactly answer to
one another. A man of the East, if he could have
brought himself to allow that the Empire had been
translated at all from his own side of Hadria, would
have said that the formula should rather speak of
a translation of the Empire from the Romans to
the Franks. But no one in the West would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
thought of saying that the Empire was translated
from the Greeks to the Romans. We have just
heard the Western Empire called, with national
pride, a Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.
But no national pride could have been called up by
speaking of the Eastern Empire as a Holy Roman
Empire of the Greek nation. For “German” was
a national name in which the men of the Western
Empire gloried; “Greek” was a name which no man
of the Eastern Empire admitted to belong to him.
It is perfectly true that the two Empires did in
the end become, the one a German, the other a
Greek state. But they became German and Greek
in different senses and by different processes. We
see at once that the Western Empire became German
through the election of a German king to its crown.
It seems ridiculous to speak, even for the sake of
pointing the contrast, of the Eastern Empire becoming
Greek by the election of a Greek king to
its crown. Something like that might happen in
the nineteenth century; it could not possibly happen
in the ninth. We may here bring in the analogy
and the contrast of which I spoke at the end of
our last lecture. The nearest analogy to be found
in the East to the Empire of Charles the Frank
would have been if Bulgarian Simeon or Servian
Stephen had been crowned Emperor of the Romans
in Saint Sophia and had from that moment reigned
over Bulgaria or Servia in his character of Emperor
of the Romans. But the nearest approach
to this was when the Tzar Simeon and the Tzar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Stephen took an Imperial style without entering
the walls of the Tzarigrad. That such was the
nearest approach in the East to the event of the year
800 is the most marked point of difference between
the positions of the Teuton in the West and the Slave
in the East. One main reason why it was the nearest
approach lies in the different positions held by the
Old and the New Rome in the two Empires. For
another main reason we must look a little further.</p>

<p>I said a few minutes back that a man in the East
might perhaps have said that the Empire was
translated to the Franks from the Romans, but that
no man in the West would ever have said that the
Empire was translated from the Greeks to the
Romans. I said also in my last lecture that one
great cause of the different position held by the
Teutons in the West and by the Slaves in the East
was that the Eastern Empire spoke with two
tongues, while the Western Empire spoke with one
tongue only. The cause of that difference has to be
sought for in far earlier stages of our subject; it is
the continuation of the difference which I pointed
out long ago between the position of Rome in the
East and in the West; the difference that, while in
both alike Rome was a ruler, in the West she was
also a teacher, while in the East she was herself
a learner. In the West Latin displaced the
native languages. We may say that no Roman ever
learned Celtic or Iberian. If any Roman ever did,
it could have been only for some immediate practical
purpose. But in the East Latin never displaced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Greek; it was not likely to displace, there was no
wish that it should displace, a tongue which every
educated Roman learned as a matter of course. The
tendency was rather the other way. At one stage,
as I pointed out in another set of lectures, Greek
went far to displace Latin as a literary tongue even
in Rome; the later Latin writers, like Ammianus
and Claudian, mark in truth a Latin reaction against
Greek influences. In the Greek East Greek lived
on and flourished; Latin was simply set up by its
side for certain purposes. The Roman Empire of
course, whether in East or West, knew no official
tongue but Latin. Latin therefore remained for ages
the tongue of government and warfare in the Roman
East, while Greek was the language of ordinary
speech, of literature, and of religion. That is to say,
the position which belonged to Latin alone in the
West was in the East divided between Latin and
Greek. It was impossible therefore that either of
those tongues should make the same way among
other nations which Latin, with its undivided supremacy,
made in the West. In those parts of
Eastern Europe where Greek had not already
established itself, the phænomena of Western Europe
showed themselves. In inland Thrace and Mœsia,
just as in Gaul and Spain, a Romance speech did
spring up, and in the wilder lands of Illyricum, the
Skipetar, the modern Albanian, still kept his own
speech, like the Basque and the Breton of the West.
Thus to the invading Teuton, the culture of the
Empire presented itself only in a single shape, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Latin shape, while the invading Slave, if he wished
to adopt the culture of the Empire, must have been
puzzled by the twofold shape, Greek and Latin, in
which it stood before him. It was an almost necessary
consequence that neither element ever had the
same influence on the Slavonic conquerors of the East
which the single Latin element had on the Teutonic
conquerors of the West.</p>

<p>I have said that the Roman Empire of the West
became by degrees a German power, and that the
Roman Empire of the East became by degrees a
Greek power. But I have said also that they became
so in different ways. We have seen that the Western
Empire became German by the process of choosing
German kings to its Emperors, and by extending the
name of Roman Empire over their German dominions.
The Eastern Empire became Greek in quite another
way. There was no transfer of Roman power to
Greek princes, no extension of the Roman name over
Greek lands. Either process might have happened
with Slavonic princes and Slavonic lands; neither
could happen with Greek princes or Greek lands, for
the simple reason that Greek princes and lands, as
distinguished from Roman, were not in being. In the
Romania of the East, in Eastern Europe and Western
Asia, Greek and Roman meant the same thing. We
have spoken of an artificial Greek nation and of an
artificial Roman nation; in the Eastern Romania
they were the same thing. Of the two tongues of
the East-Roman world, the tongue which was native
to the soil proved the stronger. Latin gradually died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
out even in its own range; it died out, that is, as a
separate speech, though not till it had poured a vast
infusion of Latin words into the official Greek vocabulary.
Greek became the one language of the Roman
Empire of the East; as in the West the Romance languages
grew up, while Latin long abode beside them as
an official, a literary, and a religious speech, so in the
East men spoke a more modern form of the Greek
tongue, while its older shape went on as the official,
the literary, and the religious speech. But down to
the coming of the Ottoman, nay down to the movement
of our own century which in some lands has
thrown off his yoke, the Roman name lived on. What
name in short should supplant it? The name of
<i>Hellên</i> had passed away; it had become synonymous
with <i>pagan</i>. The Greek name had never been used
in the Hellenic lands; it was the name by which the
Hellênes were known in the West, exactly as the
<i>Deutschen</i> and the <i>Cymry</i> are known among other
nations by other names than those by which they call
themselves. In truth the people whom the Latins
called <i>Græci</i> called themselves at one stage
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Hellênes]">Ἕλληνες</span>
and at another
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span>.
The Roman name lived on,
and well it might; there was nothing to change it.
While the Western part of the Empire was first
united to the Eastern and then separated from it,
while it was separated from it to pass to one who
was first Patrician of the Romans and then Emperor
of the Romans, but who would hardly have called
himself personally a Roman, the Eastern lands of
Rome were ruled in unbroken succession by princes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
following one another in the same Imperial seat, any
one of whom would have been amazed indeed if his
right to the Roman name had been disputed. Prince
and people alike clave to that name and knew no
other; and Romans they were, not in the same sense
as the first settlers on the Palatine, not even in
the same sense as the Volscian Cicero and the
Spaniard Trajan; but in the sense in which their
forefathers had become Romans by the edict of Antoninus.
They were Romans by the same right as
Theodosius when he came as a second Trajan from
Spain, as Jovius himself when he came from the land
that should be Tzernagora. It would have been hard
to find a Roman pedigree for Justinian; but neither
would it have been easy to find one for Aurelian.
The Greek&mdash;not the pure Hellên of old but the Greek
of the artificial nation formed by Macedonian conquest&mdash;had
the same right to the Roman name which
the Gaul had; so to be sure had the Syrian and the
Egyptian. But then the Syrian and the Egyptian
could hardly be said to accept the gift; under the
guise of national creeds, creeds that were deemed
heretical by the orthodoxy of either Rome, they
clave to an elder national being which was neither
Greek nor Roman, and they fell away from their
Roman allegiance to become not wholly unwilling
subjects of the Saracen. The very losses of the
Empire, the cutting off of its Eastern provinces,
helped, not indeed to make the Empire more Roman,
but to make Roman and Greek more thoroughly
words of the same meaning within its Eastern pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>vinces.
In the course of the seventh century, the
Oriental lands of Syria and Egypt, the Latin lands of
Spain and Africa, were finally torn away from the
Empire. Part of Latin Italy had already passed to
the Lombard; the rest now followed it to form the
kernel of the new Roman Empire of the West. The
result of all this was that, from Sicily to Tauros, the
subjects left to the Empire, the Romans of the East,
were almost wholly men of Greek speech and of what
we have called artificial Greek nationality. Within
the Eastern Empire the artificial Greek nation and
the artificial Roman nation seemed to have become
the same thing. Every Greek was a Roman; it
seemed as if every Roman was a Greek. It was not
wholly so; even within the Eastern peninsula the
Albanian and the Rouman nationalities were still to
show themselves. But to all appearance the Roman
lands of the East were as purely Greek-speaking
lands as the Roman lands of the West were Latin-speaking
lands. If the Western Empire became
German, it was by choosing a German king and in
some sort adopting his German subjects. If the
Eastern Empire became Greek, it was because the
un-Greek parts were lopped off from it. To this
process the finishing stroke was put by the event
of 800. Latin Italy then parted, even in name,
from its allegiance to the Eastern Rome. The prince
who reigned at Constantinople was by the truest
political succession Emperor of the Romans; but the
Romans who were left for him to rule over were well
nigh wholly Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way therefore, and largely by virtue of the
same act, the Eastern Empire became Greek, while the
Western Empire became German. The one became
Greek through one of its old elements obtaining an
exclusive predominance; the other became German
by bringing in an element altogether new. But in
becoming severally German and Greek, neither ceased
to be Roman. The Roman spirit might die out; but
the Roman succession went on; the Roman tradition
was never broken. In the East the tie to the Roman
past was never snapped; if it passed away, it was
because the Romans of the East seemed almost
to forget that there had ever been any Romans
but themselves or any Rome but their own. In
the West, on the other hand, the tie to the Roman
past was never formally snapped any more than
in the East; but it passed away because it was
overshadowed and stifled by the un-Roman institutions
that grew up by the side of it. The Augustus
of the East was Emperor of the Romans and nothing
more; it was strange that the diadem of Jovius should
be conferred by a Christian unction, but what the
Christian unction of the East did confer was the
diadem of Jovius and none other. The Augustus of
the West was also King of Germany, of Italy, and
of Burgundy; Aachen, Milan, Arles, had their share
in making him as well as the Eternal City. Take
away the German, the Italian, and the Burgundian
realms, and it might be hard to find on the map the
lands over which Cæsar ruled purely in his character
of Cæsar. Again, in the East, wherever the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
reigned at all, he truly reigned. Did the Empire
reach once more from Ister to Orontes, from Ararat to
Ætna? Was it shut up within a corner of Thrace and
a fragment of the coast of Asia? In either case, be
the Empire great or small, be its sovereign the mighty
Macedonian or the trembling Palaiologos, wherever he
was sovereign at all, he was
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: autokratôr]">αὐτοκράτωρ</span> in
the fullest sense. In the West, through the growth of
a new set of ideas and institutions, the Emperor, still
keeping all his titles, all his formal dignity, still worshipped
with a ceremonial only less stately than that
of his Eastern brother, gradually sank into a mere
chief of unruly feudatories, into a mere President,
it might seem, of a Confederation in which every
member was stronger than the head. An Eastern
Emperor might expect to be slain or blinded to make
room for another; but, while he kept his life and
his eyes, his will was undisputed. A Western
Emperor was commonly free from such extreme
changes of fortune. A few only died on the battle-field
or by private murder, and those few at least
enjoyed the light of heaven till their last moments.
But while they reigned, while men called them Lords
of the World, Vicars of the Almighty, if they loved
the truth of power rather than its show, they might
have been tempted to envy the smallest of their
vassals who within a few roods of ground did without
let or hindrance that which was right in his own eyes.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been drawn on, almost in spite of myself, to
paint somewhat of a picture of the main features<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
which distinguished the Eastern and Western Empires
after they were finally split asunder by the act
of the year 800. But a lecture on the Divided
Empire ought to do something more. It ought
not to shrink from the more prosaic task of sketching
the main facts of the story in their order and of
speaking a word of warning against a few notions
and forms of speech which are likely to mislead.
But it may not be useless to run with a swift step
through the revolutions of several centuries, and here
and there to throw in a needful caution. And to
understand the Divided Empire, it is first needful
to cast a glance at the Empire before it was divided.
We have to hasten as far as the thirteenth century,
a century almost as full of destiny as the fifth, but
to the fifth we must first again look back. We have
seen that at its beginning the formal boundaries of
the Empire had hardly given way; Theodosius had
reigned over at least as wide a dominion as Jovian;
and his dominion had passed to his sons reigning as
Imperial colleagues at Constantinople and at Ravenna.
In the course of that century the Vandal passes
through Gaul into Spain; he founds a Spanish
realm, and presently forsakes it for a somewhat more
lasting dominion in Africa. The Alan, marching at
his side, founds a yet more momentary dominion
in Spain and presently vanishes from the face of the
earth. The third in that great march, the Suevian,
founds his Spanish realm also and keeps it longer
than either. At the end of the century he still
holds his north-west corner; but the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
peninsula is in the hands of the West-Goth, whose
mighty kingdom stretches over Gaulish and Spanish
ground from the Loire to the pillars of Hercules.
The Burgundian has spread himself from his old
seat on the Rhine to the mouths of the Rhone and
the haven of Massalia. But the Roman name
has but lately died away from central and northern
Gaul. Cut off from either centre of Imperial rule,
a Roman land, some say, strange as the title sounds,
a Roman kingdom, has lingered on between Seine
and Loire, to yield at last to the advance of a
Teutonic people who have long played a secondary
part in the affairs of Gaul, but who are now, in the
short life-time of a single enterprising king, to spring
to a place in the world alongside of the Roman and
the Goth. The Frank has begun his march, eastward,
westward, southward, northward. For a moment he
is the heathen lord of Catholic subjects who preferred
the worshipper of Woden to the follower of Arius;
he is presently to change into the one Catholic power
of the whole world, the eldest son of the Church,
looked to through all Gaul as the deliverer of Catholic
lands from heretical rulers. And, what concerns
us more than all, while Gaul, Spain, Africa, have
passed away from the Empire, Italy and Rome itself
have, in all but name, passed away with them.
One barbarian patrician has yielded to another;
Theodoric watches over Italy as no Cæsar had
watched over it for many a year. A few years
more, and his rule stretches, under one title or
another, over the whole western half of the Medi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>terranean
lands of Europe. Yet the Roman name,
the Roman power, lives on in its Eastern half; the
one Emperor of the Romans still holds his throne
in the Eastern Rome, keeping but the shadow of
a barren title over his elder capital, but biding his
time to make that shadow a reality at the first
favourable moment.</p>

<p>So far have we followed the memorable fifth
century, the century, I repeat, in whose first years,
if at any time, modern history begins, the century
at whose end the existing nations of Europe are still
not in being, but at whose beginning they have taken,
so to speak, the first feeble steps towards coming into
being. Let us now glance at the hardly less memorable
sixth century, memorable in another way from
the fifth. The sixth century is not a creative, but
rather a reactionary age, an age which does much to
hinder the growth of new elements, and much to
bring back old elements to a place and a power
which they had lost. Of all ages in history the
sixth is the one in which the doctrine that the
Roman Empire came to an end at some time in
the fifth sounds most grotesque. Again the Roman
armies march to victory, to more than victory, to
conquest, to conquests more precious than the conquests
of Cæsar or of Trajan, to conquests which gave
back Rome herself to her own Augustus. We may
again be met with the argument that we have ourselves
used so often; that the Empire had to win back its
lost provinces does indeed prove that it had lost
them; but no one seeks to prove that the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
had not been lost; what the world is loth to understand
is that there was still life enough in the Roman
power to win them back again. I say the Roman
power; what if I said the Roman commonwealth?
It may startle some to hear that in the sixth century,
nay in the seventh, the most common name for the
Empire of Rome is still “respublica.” No epithet is
needed; there is no need to say that the “respublica”
spoken of is “respublica Romana.” It is
the Republic which wins back Italy, Africa, and
Southern Spain from their Teutonic masters. It
is the Republic which beats back from the ransomed
lands the new attacks of the Frank and the Alaman.
If Gregory the Great stoops to flatter the murderer
Phocas, he warns him also&mdash;strange as the words
sound to us&mdash;that, while the kings of the nations rule
over slaves, the Emperors of the Republic rule over
freemen. We must indeed beware of bringing in ideas
which belong wholly to modern controversy; there is
nothing in the word “respublica,” nothing in the
word “commonwealth,” nothing in the use of those
words down to a very recent date, which shuts out
the possibility of a commonwealth having a prince,
Emperor or king, as its chief ruler. The point of the
employment of the word lies in this, that it marks
the unbroken being of the Roman state; in the eyes
of the men of the sixth century the power which won
back the African province in their own day was the
same power which had first won it well nigh seven
hundred years before. The consul Belisarius was the
true successor of the consul Scipio. Again the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Roman power stretches from the Ocean to the
Euphrates; the mighty volume of the Roman law
is unrolled alike for the Syrian and the Spaniard.
The whole Mediterranean coast is again the seaboard
of Rome, save where the West-Goth still keeps his
hold on Septimania and Northern Spain, save where
the Empire has itself yielded the coast from Rhone
to the Alps to the Frankish lords of Gaul who have
wiped out the power of the Burgundian and cut
short the West-Goth on Gaulish soil. The common
teaching on these matters is so wretched that I
believe we all of us feel&mdash;I still feel myself&mdash;a
certain feeling of strangeness and incongruity at the
mere picture of the revived Empire of the sixth
century. Or if strangeness and incongruity are
words too strong, we at least feel that it is a truth
which needs asserting, asserting, it may be, till times
seventy times seven, in the ears of the unlearned
and unbelieving. To look on it, as the men of the
time looked on, as the restoration of a lawful order
of things which had been violently interrupted is
one of the hardest of historic lessons.</p>

<p>But there is no popular delusion which does not
contain some measure of truth, however disguised
and distorted. No way of speaking can be more
misleading than that which is still employed, even by
some eminent scholars, of speaking of the Empire of
Justinian, of the armies of Justinian, as Greek. It is
not only formally wrong, but it does not in any way
express the facts. Even before the reconquest of the
West, the Greek element was far indeed from being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the exclusive, it was hardly the predominant element
in the Empire; and to apply the name to the enlarged
Empire, largely inhabited by a Latin population, which
Justinian passed on to his successors is more misleading
still. And in the army above all, made up from
all manner of warlike tribes within and without the
Empire, the proportion of men who were in any sense
of Greek birth, even the proportion of men to whom
Greek was their native speech, must have been small
indeed. Yet we have the memorable fact, showing
itself in the narrative of Procopius and in the very
beginnings of English literature, that both on Gothic
and on English lips the subjects of the Emperor who
reigned at Constantinople were spoken of as Greeks.
No wonder; the Goths, marching to and fro in the
eastern peninsula, must have heard more Greek spoken
than any other tongue; so must the first of English
travellers, be the travels of the singer of the song real
or imaginary. And the name was given almost by a
prophetic instinct, as if the Goth, unfettered by Roman
traditions, saw that an Empire of which Byzantium
was the head, if not Greek already, must some day
become such. What if Justinian had seen that fact
and had acted on it? What if he had grasped his
position as before all things lord of the great eastern
peninsula of Europe and the great western peninsula
of Asia, lord that is of lands still partly Latin, but far
more widely Greek? What if he had given his whole
mind to the defence of his northern frontier against
Slavonic and Hunnish invaders, and had left the
Teutonic and Latin elements in Italy, Spain, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Africa to settle themselves as they settled themselves
in Gaul? It may well be that such a course would
have been the wiser; looking at the matter with the
light of thirteen later centuries, we are strongly
tempted to say that so it would have been. But we
must remember that the light of those thirteen later
centuries could give no help to the minds of men
whose destiny had fixed them in the sixth century.
As Justinian or any man of his age must have looked
on the world of the sixth century, an Emperor of the
Romans, reigning in the New Rome but shut out
from the Old, must not only have been tempted by
every feeling of ambition, he must have honestly
felt it as the highest of his Imperial duties, to win
back the lost lands of Rome, to win back Rome herself,
for the Roman commonwealth of which he found
himself the head.</p>

<p>The great revival of the Empire in the sixth
century was but the first of a long series of revivals
which marked the history of the power whose head
was at Constantinople down to its latest stages. In
its long annals, the successors of Cæsar and Trajan,
the men who extend the borders of the Empire over
new lands, are far from wholly lacking; the successors
of Valentinian and Belisarius, the men who win back
the lost lands, are never lacking down to the last
generation of the Palaiologoi. But the first and
greatest burst of this power of springing to new life
was that which came while the Empire still was one,
when Belisarius, deliverer of Africa and Sicily, sent
the keys of ransomed Rome to her own Emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
True, as we have seen, a large part of Italy was lost
again before the century was out; the Spanish province
passed away early in the next century; but the
successors of Justinian still ruled at Carthage till the
last years of the seventh century; they still ruled, in
name at least, at Rome till the last year of the eighth.
No confusion can be greater or more misleading than
that which looks on the Empire of Tiberius, Maurice,
and Heraclius as something strange and anomalous,
something to be labelled as Eastern, Byzantine, perhaps
Greek, to be called anything in short but its
true name of Roman. Never, I would say to all
of you, use the words “Eastern” or “Byzantine,” till
there is something Western to oppose to them. You
may distinguish Nikêphoros as the Eastern Emperor
as opposed to the Western Emperor Charles; but
never speak of Maurice or Heraclius as anything but
the sole Roman Emperor that he was. Still in the
days of Heraclius the process begins which was to
leave the Empire of Nikêphoros, if not a Greek power,
at least a power fast hastening to become Greek. The
mightiest of Imperial warriors, he who overleaped the
fame of Trajan to renew the fame of Alexander, the
deliverer of Rome, the conqueror of Persia, the man
who brought back the holiest of Christian relics from
its heathen bondage, lived to be the man who saw
Syria and Egypt lopped away from his Empire, who
saw the Holy City that he had redeemed pass away
into the hands of misbelievers yet more terrible than
those whom he had overthrown. It may be that the
Empire gained even by these fearful losses; it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
plain that after its Oriental and its Latin provinces
are lost, it begins to put on somewhat of the strength
of a national power, even though that power had
no thought of its own nationality. It may even
be that the great Isaurian Emperors of the eighth
century let the remnant of Latin Italy slip from their
hands almost without an effort, because they saw that
a dominion which was becoming foreign to the great
mass of the Empire was no true source of strength.
To reign from Hæmus to Tauros, to be lord at Trebizond
and at Syracuse, to beat back the Bulgarian in
Europe and the Saracen in Asia&mdash;it was no mean
task, no easy task, which fell to the lot of the “effete”
“Greek of the Lower Empire;” he might well deem
that he had work enough to do in the lands which
naturally looked up to the New Rome, and that he
might leave the Old to set up again for itself, if such
was its own good pleasure.</p>

<p>Set up for itself it did, as we have already seen;
but it set up for itself mainly to deck a German
king and a German kingdom with its own Roman
memories. Charles, like Theodoric, had called into
being a system which it needed himself to work.
He could be at once German King and Roman
Cæsar in deed as well as in name. His immediate
successors found it hard to be either. By the end
of the ninth century the great Frankish dominion
was broken in pieces; the crown of the Western
Rome passed, now to a prince of Italy, now to
a prince of Germany, now to a prince of Gaul.
Under the second Lewis Italy came nearer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
forming an united and separate realm than she
did at any other moment between Theodoric and
Victor Emmanuel. For that moment there seemed
a chance&mdash;that is, we, a thousand years after
the time, see that there was a chance&mdash;that
there might be, not a German, but an Italian Empire
of the Western Rome, to match the Greek
Empire of the Eastern Rome. But it was fated
that the traditions of the Western Rome should
neither abide in Italy with Lewis and Berengar
nor pass into Gaul with Charles the Bald. The
German King, the Saxon King, the first of the
Ottos, came down to receive the crown of Rome
as a deliverer, to pass it on to a grandson who
seemed for a moment to have the mission, not only
of reviving the Roman power, but of making the
elder Rome herself once more the local seat of
Imperial dominion.</p>

    <p>Vivo Ottone tertio,</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the “mirabilia mundi” passed to an early
grave; the true work of his house was, not to
restore the local power of Rome, but to fix that
the Western Empire of Rome, the now Holy Roman
Empire, should be, down to the moment of its last
shadowy being, a Roman Empire of the German
nation. It is that Empire, the Empire of the Ottos,
the Henries, and the Fredericks, the Empire to
whose worthiest chief men could pay their tribute
of renewed Saturnian song;</p>

<p class="noindent">the Empire whose true power and glory was buried
in the grave of “Fridericus stupor mundi,” but
whose shadow lived on to inspire the heart of Dante,
whose traditions lived on to win for the Imperial
name one flash of seeming might in the days of
Henry of Luxemburg, one flash more dazzling still
in the days of that Charles who was the last to
take its crown, though not in the old crowning-place
of the first&mdash;it is this great fact of all
European history, the fact whose greatness has been
so well proclaimed by a scholar and statesman of
whom this University is proud, which has now to
divide our thoughts with that other side of the
divided Roman power whose annals, for some ages
at least as glorious, were wound up by a far more
glorious end. As the warrior’s death of the last
Constantine is another tale from the self-abasement
of the last Francis, so in the brighter days of
either power we may claim for the Empire of
the Macedonians at least an equal place in the
world alongside of the Empire of the Old-Saxons.
While the third Otto was dreaming of the coming
glories of the Old Rome, the second Basil was
filling the New with the trophies of all lands
from the Danube to the Orontes, from the Pharos
of Messana to the roots of Caucasus. And let us
pause for a moment to think once more what might
have been. What if the Slayer of the Bulgarians
had failed in his sternest struggle, when he and
his Empire strove, year after year, locked tight in
the death-grapple with rivals worthy of them?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
What if Samuel of Ochrida, and not Baldwin of
Bruges or Mahomet of Brusa, had made his way
within the walls of Constantinople, on an errand
matching the errand of the first Otto in the West,
to make the Imperial city abide for ever a seat of
Christian rule, as the head of a Roman Empire of the
Slavonic Nation?</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>One question now comes which might well have
come sooner. In the days of the Divided Empire,
when Europe and Christendom had two rival heads,
how did either bear itself towards the greatest work
of all, the special calling of Europe and of Christendom?
How did the Cæsars of East and West bear
themselves in the Eternal Question of the world’s
history? The Persian victories of Heraclius were
the last work, the last glories, we might almost
say the greatest and noblest glories, of the undivided
Empire. The next moment the Eternal Question
put on that more fearful and more abiding shape
which it still bears in our own day. The two Semitic
creeds, the most antagonistic of all creeds simply
because they have so much in common, the creed
of Rome and the West, the creed of Arabia and the
East, stood forth as new badges for each side, badges
under which each side drew new life for the eternal
struggle. Syria and Egypt, which had little to lose
by falling away, fell away, as we have seen, in a
moment; Latin Africa, which had much to lose,
fought on for sixty years; the Roman strove more
manfully for Carthage than the Goth strove for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Spain and Septimania. But Africa was lost for
ever; the unconquerable lands of northern Spain,
the Tzernagora of the West, bred up a line of heroes
to win back their own land from the intruder. The
Frank, Hammer in hand, crashed the enemy before
he crossed the border stream of Loire; and the first
king of the new line won a higher glory than that
of Frankish king and Roman patrician by ending
the short rule of the Mussulman around the temple
and the arena of Nîmes and on the tower-crowned
hill of Carcassonne. Nor did the New Rome fail
in the work; vainly did the last companions of
the Prophet strive to win the fulfilment of his
promise that the sins of the first believing army
that entered the city of the Cæsars should be forgiven.
As the Persian had been beaten back in
the days of Heraclius, so was the Arab beaten back
in the days of his descendants. Again he came;
but the strong arm of the Isaurian Leo again saved
the New Rome and the whole world of Christendom.
The strife of the old days came again in Sicily;
again Europe and Africa, again Aryan and Semitic
man&mdash;Aryan men who spoke the tongue of Greece
and Semitic men who ruled where Carthage had
twice been&mdash;strove, in the cycle of the ages, for the
island that was called on to be the meeting-place,
the battle-field, of creeds and tongues and nations.
Sicily was lost, yet Tauromenion on its height,
looking down on the Ebbsfleet of Hellenic Sicily,
held out for almost a hundred years; short indeed
were the two intervals when the Infidel could boast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
himself master of the whole of that memorable island.
If Tauromenion and Rametta fell at last, the sword
of George Maniakês was soon to be sharpening; if
Syracuse was won and lost again, the sword of
Norman Roger was already sharpening for a deliverance
more abiding.</p>

<p>Long and stern indeed was the strife which the
Romans of the East had to wage to guard Tauros
against the Saracen, while they had to wage a strife
no less abiding to guard Hæmus against the Bulgarian.
But as long as the Saracen alone had to be
striven against, the work was done. Then came the
day of reconquest, the days of Nikêphoros Phokas, of
John Tzimiskês, of the awful Basil himself. The
eleventh century begins as the greatest century of
Byzantine history; before its end a new enemy has
come; the Asiatic side of the Eternal Question has
passed to a new champion; what the Arab failed
to do, the Turk has begun to do indeed. The Romania
of Asia has ceased to be a Christian land of the
Empire; but a Roman land it seems hardly to cease to
be, while Nikaia, birthplace of Christian orthodoxy,
destined in after times to be the seat of the most
vigorous of Eastern survivals of the Roman power,
holds the throne of a Mussulman, the throne of a
Turk, but a Mussulman and a Turk whose style is
Sultan of Rome.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hurried indeed is the glance that is all that we
can take of the Empire thus split asunder between
two rivals. The true power and greatness of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
come to an end in the great age of creation and destruction,
the thirteenth century of our æra. In the
West, the Roman Empire and the German kingdom do
not indeed come to a formal end, but they lose their
ancient place beside the grave of Frederick the Second.
In the East, the Empire, as a local power, gains a new
lease of national strength, but it loses its œcumenical
position when the Latin reigns at Constantinople,
when the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaios]">Ῥωμαῖος</span>,
however we translate his name,
reigns beyond the Bosporos at Nikaia. Thus far we
have had still to deal with the true and ancient substance
of the Empire, even if parted asunder into two
bodies. We shall have next to speak of powers which
kept on its name and its traditions, but which in
sober truth we can hardly look on as more than its
shadows and survivals.</p>

  <h2>LECTURE V.<br />
  SURVIVALS OF EMPIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I drew</span>
a distinction in my last lecture between two
stages in the dying out of the Roman power and its
traditions. There were times when the two Empires
of East and West, however changed their character
from what it had been in earlier times, however far
they had gone, the one to become Greek, the other
to become German, might still be held to keep the
essence of their old Roman being. And there were
later times when the names and traditions of Rome
still lingered on, but when they could not be looked
on as more than shadows and survivals. I wish it of
course to be understood that this division between
these times is an arbitrary line of my own drawing.
In the West at least it does not answer to any such
marked epoch as the event of 800, the event of 1453,
the event of 1806. I drew the line at the death of
Frederick the Second. We shall, I think, all allow
that, if Frederick the Second represents a state of
things which had become very unlike the state of
things under Trajan or even under Constantine,
Francis the Second represents a state of things at
least as unlike the state of things under Frederick.
But it does not follow that, if a line is to be drawn,
every one would draw it at the death of Frederick.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
It might be said that the Empire had become a mere
German state before his day, that the position of
Frederick was exceptional, that his importance in
Italian affairs really belonged to the King of Sicily
and not to the Emperor of the Romans, that the
career even of his grandfather showed that in his
time the Roman claims of the German kings had
become thoroughly unreal, and rested wholly on the
strength of their German armies. Another might
draw the line much later; he might say that the true
Empire passed away when an Emperor, a third
Frederick most unlike the First and Second, took his
crown for the last time before the altar of old Saint
Peter’s. He might draw it when that Frederick’s son
took an Imperial style, though to be sure with a
qualifying adjective, without any show of Imperial
crowning. Or he might draw it when the last <i>Imperator</i>,
successor of the first <i>Imperator electus</i>, took
the crown of the Empire, not before the altar of Saint
Peter at Rome, but before the altar of Saint Petronius
at Bologna. The last is indeed an epoch-making
moment; Charles the Fifth does seem to wind up
with some fitting dignity that Imperial line which
began with Charles the Great. And as the last
Emperor, as distinguished from Emperors-elect, he
does truly wind it up. The gap between Charles
and Ferdinand is in truth a wide one. But surely
there is a still wider gap between Frederick the
Wonder of the World and princes like William of
Holland, Richard of Cornwall, and even, when looked
on from the Imperial side, as Rudolf of Habsburg.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Rudolf is indeed different from William and Richard;
he is great and famous as German King; but the
line of Emperors knows him not. The fact that the
man whom we may call the restorer of the German
kingdom never sought the Imperial crown seems of
itself to point to the reign of the last Emperor before
him, even if that Emperor had not been Frederick
the Second, as the time when the Empire, as a power
in itself, and not simply as a lofty title, a mighty
memory, came to an end. Under Charles the Fifth
the Empire seems to spring again to the fulness of
its ancient power; but his abdication and death revealed
a truth. When his titles of Empire passed
to Ferdinand and his European position passed to
Philip, it became clear that, however the titles of
Empire might make the position of Charles more
brilliant, his might had not really been the might of
the Empire, but the might of Burgundy and Castile.
The line, wherever we draw it, is an arbitrary one,
unmarked either by formal changes or by events of
the first greatness. I think we shall all agree that
the Peace of Constanz and the Peace of Westfalia
are the acts of a power which in the earlier time still
kept much of a really Roman position, while in the
later time all truly Roman character had passed from
it. The change between the two states of things is
gradual; at what point between the two we choose
to draw the line is largely matter of opinion, one
might say rather matter of taste or of feeling.</p>

<p>In the East our case is much clearer. The event
of 1204 is one that stands out with far greater dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tinctness
than the event of 1250. No years in the
Byzantine annals are more honourable than those in
which they for a while cease to be Byzantine. It is
when the
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span>
again become Byzantine that they
again degenerate. If the name of Roman is to be held
as an epithet of honour, at no time did prince and
people better deserve that name than when they were
banished from the New Rome. Adversity brought
out vigorous qualities indeed in the Emperors of
Nikaia and their subjects. Yet the fact that they
were Emperors of Nikaia and not of Constantinople
puts a wide barrier between them and their predecessors.
The life of the Eastern Empire had been
so thoroughly bound up in the possession of the
Eastern Rome that no change could seem so great
as that which gave the Eastern Rome to a Latin
stranger. The Empire of Nikaia proved in the
end the most vigorous and abiding among its
fellows; but it had fellows. It was only one of
a crowd of states, Greek and Latin, into which the
Roman Empire of the East was broken in pieces.
That the old Empire was utterly broken in pieces,
that its old position had wholly passed away, is
shown by unavoidable changes in language. It is
now indeed hard to avoid using the word <i>Greek</i>.
To be sure no Orthodox speaker of the Greek
tongue&mdash;that is now the definition of the artificial
Greek nation&mdash;dreamed of calling himself
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Hellên]">Ἕλλην</span>;
the Greeks, the Griffons, of Western speakers were
still everywhere
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span>
in their own eyes. Strange
indeed is the opposition of names in these days.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
When we find
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Latinoi]">Λατῖνοι</span>
opposed, we seem
to be carried back to the consulship of Manlius and
Decius; when somewhat earlier we find a strife
between
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Albanoi]">Ἀλβανοί</span>,
we seem to be carried
back from the pages of Anna to the pages
of Dionysios, from the reign of Alexios to the reign
of Tullus. But now that Emperors, Kings, Despots,
Dukes, Grand-Sires, outlying possessions of Italian
commonwealths and Italian families, have become
thick on the ground and still thicker on the waters,
we can hardly use any other name than <i>Greek</i> to
distinguish a prince or a people speaking the later
shape of the tongue of Hellas from princes and
people speaking the later shapes of the tongue of
Latium. When we step within the range of theological
controversy, our difficulties become greater
still. If we keep to our elder language, the special
badge of the Roman will be that he denies the
authority of the Roman Church. The Roman name,
as the formal name of a power, ceased only in 1453,
or rather in 1461. The Roman name, as the name
of a people, can hardly be said to have even now
passed away. But from 800 onwards we may fairly
use such distinguishing forms as “Eastern” and
“Byzantine”; from 1204 onwards we can hardly help
adopting the Western language of the time, and
speaking of those scattered fragments of the Eastern
Empire which were still held by its own people as
“Greek.”</p>

<p>The Empire of Nikaia may seem to have well
proved its right to be looked on as the true successor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of the old Empire by the great exploit of winning
back the Imperial city. For eight hundred years
we have had to deal with powers that win back
oftener than with powers that can be strictly said
to advance; but to win back Constantinople in the
thirteenth century was to gain a richer prize than
even to win back Rome in the sixth. Without
Constantinople an East-Roman or Greek Empire
might seem to have no position in the face of the
world. In possession of Constantinople, it might
seem to be brought back to something like its old
place among powers and nations. Still the Empire
of the Palaiologoi was but a feeble representative,
a mere shadow and survival, not only of the Empire
of the Macedonians, but of the Empire of the Komnênoi.
For a while it was an advancing power in
Europe; even when its northern frontiers had fallen
back before the Bulgarian, the Servian, the Ottoman
himself, it could still advance in the old Greek
lands. It showed the Byzantine power of revival in
its last and strangest form, when the whole of
Peloponnêsos, bating the points held by Venice, was
again united under a Greek prince. In those days
it was something for the Roman Empire to outlive
the principality of Achaia, days when the Isle of
Pelops formed the main body of an Empire of which
the city of Constantine was the distant head. If
the last Emperor of the West took his crown at
Bologna, the last Emperor of the East took his on
the spot which had been Sparta. But “Emperor of
the East” I should not say. That is one of the many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
conventional ways of describing the princes of the
Eastern Rome, the use of which may sometimes help
to turn a sentence. But no prince reigning at Constantinople
ever called himself Emperor of the East,
and there was another prince who did. In those
days Empires arose and fell with speed in the
Eastern world. Even before 1204, a stranger born
on English soil, a Count of Poitou whom a strange
chance made also King of England, had the privilege
of overthrowing an Emperor of the Romans whose
Empire was bounded by the isle of Cyprus. Master
of that island, that old battle-field of Aryan and
Semitic man, he had the wisdom to get rid of an
useless possession, and to bestow it as a kingdom
on a vassal of his own who had lately been King
of Jerusalem. So, after the great crash of the Latin
conquest, momentary Emperors had reigned in Epeiros
and at Thessalonikê. But there was yet another
Imperial claimant whose power, like that of him of
Nikaia, was more than momentary. It should never
be forgotten that the last fragment of Greek-speaking
Roman power that the world saw lingered on,
not in Megarian Byzantium but at Arkadian Trebizond.
As the northern shore of the Euxine saw
the last Greek commonwealth, so its southern shore
saw the last Greek Empire. For Greek we must
call it. The Komnênos at Trebizond, admitting the
superiority of the Palaiologos at Constantinople,
cast aside his Roman style, and called himself among
other titles Emperor of the East. The West had
long before heard of an Emperor of Britain and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
an Emperor of the Spains; but now for the first
time in the East a man was found calling himself
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: autokratôr]">αὐτοκράτωρ</span>, but
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: autokratôr]">αὐτοκράτωρ</span>
of something else and not
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaiôn]">Ῥωμαίων</span>.
But an Emperor
of the East, an Emperor of all the East,
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: pasês tês anatolês]">πάσης τῆς ἀνατολῆς</span>,
still keeps about him something of the
sublimity of vagueness; his Imperial style has a
better sound than the Imperial style of a German
duchy or a negro island; an Emperor of the East
does not seem to be cabined, cribbed, confined, within
quite such a paltry space as an Emperor of Hayti or
an Emperor of Austria. Still a prince who called
himself Emperor, but did not dare to call himself
Emperor of the Romans, proclaimed himself by his
very style to be, to use the most civil words, a
shadow and a survival. Indeed there is a curious
analogy between the survival at Trebizond and the
survival at Vienna. The Komnênos and the Lotharingian
each cast aside his Roman style, to carry on
the business, as our own expounder of things Imperial
puts it, under another name.</p>

<p>But, if we cannot allow the so-called Empires of
Cyprus, Epeiros, and Trebizond, or even the restored
Byzantine Empire of the Palaiologoi, to be more than
shadows and survivals of the old Roman Empire of
the East, they did at least continue it in the sense in
which any whole may be said to be continued in its
fragments. We can hardly say that that Empire
was in the same sort continued either in the Turkish
Sultanate of <i>Roum</i> or in the Latin Empire of <i>Romania</i>.
Truly they are shadows and survivals of the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Empire; but shadows and survivals of a different
kind from those at Epeiros and Trebizond. That
the Seljuk lords of Nikaia should have been called
Sultans of <i>Roum</i>, that the Ottoman lord of Constantinople
and his people should bear the same Roman
name among the nations of the further East, that,
before the Ottoman was lord of Constantinople,
Bajazet should have been addressed by Timour as the
<i>Keiser of Roum</i>, all these things are strange and
startling tributes to the abiding life of the Roman
name, but of little more than the name. The Latin
Empire of Romania is more remarkable. Two or
three centuries earlier, if a band of Western warriors
had made their way into Constantinople, their most
obvious legal pretext, if they had sought for a legal
pretext, would have been the establishment of the
authority of the Emperor crowned at Rome over the
Eastern as well as the Western portion of the
Empire. To German crusaders such a thought might
possibly have presented itself even in the thirteenth
century; Constantinople might have been claimed
for the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation
with more show of reason than Prussia or Livonia.
But the thought was not likely to come into the
minds of Frenchmen, of Flemings, of Venetians so
lately themselves vassals of the Eastern Emperor,
of Italians other than the most zealous Ghibelins.
Earlier crusaders had consented to become liegemen
of Alexios Komnênos, and if some refused or delayed,
it was certainly not out of loyalty to Henry of
Franconia. The men of Pisa, firm stay of Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in the West, did not scruple to fight for his Eastern
rival against the Latin invaders. That the chief
of the conquerors took the title of Emperor was
in itself a confession that Constantinople was a
lawful seat of Empire; but difficulties on either side
might hinder the authors of the new Imperial style
from literally translating
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaiôn basileus]">Ῥωμαίων βασιλεύς</span>
as the
description of a Latin potentate. The style became
territorial; Baldwin and Henry shrank, not unreasonably,
from calling themselves Emperors of the
Roman people, but they did not shrink from proclaiming
themselves Emperors of a Roman land. A
strange position it was that the Latin Emperors of
Romania held during the two generations of their
rule in Constantinople. Almost more strange is the
long cleaving of Western opinion to their supposed
rights after the Greek princes and people again held
their old home.</p>

<p>We may then, I think, fix, with some confidence,
the year 1204 as the time when the true Roman Empire
of the East came to an end. The various Greek
powers continue it, but they continue it only as fragments;
none of them can claim to be the very thing
itself, however cut short. But they are genuine
fragments; if not the very thing itself, they are
pieces of it. In the East
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: Rhômaioi]">Ῥωμαῖοι</span>
had become the
name of a nation, distinct and easily recognized, if
artificial, and Trebizond and Epeiros, no less than
Constantinople, sheltered fragments of that divided
nation. The Western Empire in its later, its purely
German, shape, does not in the same way continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the national existence of any people that could be
called even artificial Romans. It continues Roman
titles and memories; as so doing, it is a true survival
of the Roman power, but it has passed away from all
Roman national life to become no small element in
the national life of another people. It became the
Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, and the
German nation felt itself lifted up by having the
Holy Roman Empire in its keeping. After 1250 we
begin to feel that there is something incongruous
even in the Imperial coronation. The personal dignity
of Henry of Luxemburg veils the fact that even
he was not like the Franks and the Swabians; Lewis
of Bavaria is rather the great subject of Imperial
theories than a doer of any Imperial deeds. We
come to Charles the Fourth and Frederick the Third;
the crowning of Charles at Rome may be bracketted
with his crowning at Arles, and Frederick will call
forth a smile on the most Ghibelin of lips, as we see
him in cope and crown, Augustus and <i>Pater Patriæ</i>
and something like <i>Pontifex</i> as well, in that strange
gathering of men of all ages which keeps watch
over his penniless son at Innsbrück. On the other
hand, if the Eastern survivals, unlike the Western,
kept on a national being which might in some sort
be called Roman, the Western, the German, shadow
of Empire had the advantage of unity. It was one
survival and not many. There is no formal break
between 800 and 1806. The difference is the difference
between a thing which is utterly broken in
pieces, but of which each fragment keeps, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
a fragment can, the character of the whole, and a
thing which lives on, which never loses its personality,
which is never broken in pieces, but which so
changes its character that to speak of it as the same
thing, though technically accurate, strikes us as no
longer expressing the real facts. In many points
there is a wider difference between the Empire of
the first Cæsars and the Empire of the Hohenstaufen
than there is between the Empire of the Hohenstaufen
and the Empire of the Austrians and Lorrainers. But
the Hohenstaufen Emperors still felt as Emperors and
acted as Emperors; whether their objects were wise
or foolish, possible or impossible, they were still Imperial
objects, objects that reached far beyond the
bounds of Swabia or of Germany. Among the other
princes of the West they held something more than
a mere precedency. The kings of France, of Britain,
of Spain, might deny their supremacy, but they
denied it as a thing which needed to be denied;
they might refuse to acknowledge the Emperor as
their lord, but they still felt that the one Emperor was
a being of another class from the kings around him
who might or might not be his men. Their whole
position was not German but European; if not the
sovereigns, they were at least the chiefs, of all
Western Christendom. But the Austrian Emperors
sank to be Kings of Germany keeping the titles of
Empire, and Kings of Germany who had much less
authority in their own kingdom than other kings.
For in truth the German kingdom had given way
beneath the weight of the Roman Empire. The Im<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>perial
tradition had first split the kingdom in pieces,
and had then kept the pieces from altogether falling
apart. The Emperor was set too high in formal dignity
to exercise the ordinary authority of lesser kings.
We cannot speak of the Austrian Emperors as chiefs
of Western Christendom, though, in a character which
was not Imperial, they might sometimes become its
champions. The Swabian Emperors were, if not
above, at least before, all other princes; the Austrians
can barely maintain their right to be the first among
them. They keep at most a barren precedency, and
even that is not always undisputed. Their policy is
not European; it is hardly German; it seeks only
the advancement of their own house in Germany and
out of it. At last they seem altogether to forget who
and what they are. When an Emperor-elect of the
Romans, King of Germany and Jerusalem, could cast
aside his Roman and German style, his Roman and
German speech, and could describe himself as “Empereur
d’Allemagne et d’Autriche” in a treaty with
one who called himself “Empereur des Français,” it
was time that the ancient titles should yet be used
in one document more, in that which should announce
to the world that, as the titles had now ceased to
have a meaning, the thing which they described had
ceased to be.</p>

<p>Of the two men who, under those strange and
novel descriptions, signed the Treaty of Pressburg, if
one had forgotten who and what he was, the other
knew perfectly well who and what he was. The first
Buonaparte did not, like writers and orators now-a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>-days,
use the words “Emperor” and “Empire” simply
to sound fine. When he called himself “Emperor
of the French,” he knew perfectly well what
he meant by the name. What he meant involved to
be sure a few historical misrepresentations, but they
were misrepresentations which were very convenient
for his purpose. Once grant that Austrasian Charles
and Corsican Buonaparte were alike Frenchmen, and
the theory does not hang badly together. The lordship
of the world, at the lowest the supremacy of
Western Europe, was translated from Rome and
Germany to France. The ruler of France held the
position in the world which the rulers of Rome and
Germany once had held. So it was in fact; the
style of 1804 did but put that fact into very emphatic
words. There was again an Emperor, a
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span> with
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: rhêges]">ῥῆγες</span>
around him; only that
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span> was
no longer Roman, Greek, or German, but, by conquest
at least, French. It might even add a malicious
sweetness to the new Imperial position to reckon
Rome and Germany among the subject lands of
France. The first French Empire was not a mere
survival of the Roman Empire in any of its stages;
nor was it a mere analogy, as when we apply the
Imperial name to barbarian princes who hold an Imperial
position in their own world. The Empire of the
Moguls in many things repeated the Empire of the
Cæsars; but it repeated it unconsciously. But about
the French Empire everything was conscious; every
detail of imposture had a meaning. It was not in
any sense a survival, neither was it a true revival;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
it was in some sort a mockery, in some sort an
imitation, a spurious branch of the same stock,
a parody of the old Empire set up in a kind of
strange rivalry on the ground of the old Empire.
But the old Empire was not made but grew; it took
a long time even to crumble in pieces. The new
Empire, made by one man, grew mightily for a few
years, and then broke asunder in a moment. Still
the new Civilis, the man who made the Empire of
the Gauls, must be allowed the doubtful pre-eminence
of being, if
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: kakopragmôn]">κακοπράγμων</span>,
at least
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: megalopragmôn]">μεγαλοπράγμων</span> also.
Of the grotesque imitation of his work to which some
bowed down not twenty years back, it is needless to
speak.</p>

<p>I spoke just now of a document, the treaty of Pressburg,
which was signed by two personages described
as the “Emperor of the French” and the “Emperor
of Germany and Austria.” It must never be forgotten
that the title of “Emperor of Austria” dates,
not from 1806 but from 1804. The King of Germany,
Emperor-elect of the Romans, while he still held the
highest place on earth, thought good to call himself
“Hereditary Emperor of Austria”&mdash;<i>Erbkaiser von
Oesterreich</i>. What the two titles meant side by side,
no man can tell; but when the Roman and German
titles were dropped, the so-called “Empire of Austria”
went on as a distinct survival of the old Empire, and
a very memorable survival too. For it is the most
successful imposture on record. This use of an Imperial
style has caused a power which is in its own
nature modern, upstart, and revolutionary, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
looked on as ancient, venerable, and conservative.
A power of yesterday, which has lived only by
trampling on every historic right and every national
memory, has somehow come to be looked on as the
very embodiment of dignified and conservative antiquity.
But the particular way in which the imposture
has succeeded is the most wonderful thing
of all. In the last century among ourselves Smithson
thought good to call himself Percy, and the
world believes that he is Percy. But the world believes
that Smithson is Percy; it does not believe
that the old Percies were Smithsons. This last is
what is believed in the Austrian case. Nobody
believes that the present King of Hungary and
Archduke of Austria is Emperor of the Romans and
King of Germany. But many believe that real
Emperors of the Romans and Kings of Germany
were, what he calls himself, Emperors of Austria.
I have seen Frederick Barbarossa called “Emperor
of Austria;” half the world believes that the Pragmatic
Sanction of Charles the Sixth settled an
Empire of Austria on Maria Theresa; I have seen a
book of the eighteenth century in which Joseph the
Second was of course spoken of simply as “the
Emperor,” but in which the editor in the nineteenth
century thought it needful to explain that the
“Emperor” spoken of was “Emperor of Austria.”
I have found natives of Switzerland on their ground
who believed that the Imperial eagle carved on this
or that ancient building was the badge of Austria
and not of Rome. Yes; never was imposture more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
successful; never was the truth of history more
thoroughly turned round. It would be somewhat
hard to bear if Francis of Lorraine were thought to
be something like Frederick of Hohenstaufen; but
the dead may turn in their graves when Frederick
of Hohenstaufen is thought to be something like
Francis of Lorraine.</p>

<p>The truth is that the strange neglect into which
the Imperial history has fallen, the general incapacity
or unwillingness to grasp the leading fact in the
whole history of Europe, is largely owing to the
existence and the success of the great Austrian imposture.
But there are two other European powers
which also take to themselves the Imperial style, and
each of which is in a certain sense a revival of the
old Empire. Neither the Russian nor the German
Empire can be allowed to be more than a survival of
the true Empire; but neither of them is a sheer
imposture like the so-called Empire of Austria. The
German Empire called yesterday into being is a real
new birth of the old German kingdom. Its head, with
no claim to represent the Imperial position of Charles
and Otto, is a real representative of Henry of Saxony
and Rudolf of Habsburg. But so many Kings of Germany
had been Emperors that it might have seemed
strange to make a King of Germany and not to call
him Emperor. And it would have been hard to find
any lower title for the head of a Confederation which
numbers other kings among its members. Such an
one in truth has in some sort an Imperial position;
he too, like Agamemnôn or Æthelstan, is a
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
with his
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: rhêges]">ῥῆγες</span>
round him. The elder Empire of Russia
stands on quite another ground. So far as it is an Imperial
survival, it is a survival of the Empire of the
East. The Tzar of Moscow belongs to the same class
as the Tzars of Bulgaria and Servia. We have seen
how the Slavonic powers which, while assaulting the
Empire, bowed down before the greatness of the Empire,
took to themselves its Imperial titles, and bore
outside the Tzarigrad the lofty style which they
would have been better pleased to bear within its
walls. And since the fall of Constantinople, the
Russian princes, to say nothing of some supposed
kindred with the last Imperial house, have, as the
most powerful princes of the Eastern Church, stepped
into something like the general position in the world
which had belonged to the Eastern Emperors. With
less of geographical connexion, they certainly represent
the Eastern Empire with far more of truth than
any modern Western power can claim to represent
the Western Empire. Only the title of “Emperor
of all the Russias” can hardly be accepted as a truth,
as long as two Russian lands, the lands of Halicz and
Vladimir, are tied on to the Austrian duchy on the
strength of having been in far distant ages conquered
by a Hungarian king.</p>

<p>In all these powers then which bear or have borne
the Imperial style, Russia, Germany, Austria, France
under the first Buonaparte, we can see a distinct
connexion with the Roman power. The thought
of the Roman power in some of its forms and stages
was present to the minds of those by whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Imperial style was taken. But the application of
that style to so many powers has gone far to take
from it any distinct meaning. I will not say that
the words “Empire” and “Imperial” were always
in my younger days used with a conscious reference
to Rome and her memories; but I will say that they
were not used quite as they are now, simply to sound
fine. A poet or an orator might use them in some
impassioned strain; men did not in every day speech
talk about “the Empire” as familiarly as they talk
about “the parish.” A little time back, in opposition
to this new insular whim, “Empire” always meant
something specially French. Even the cant phrase
of “the Second Empire” to mean the dominion of
the last Buonaparte has, I suspect, done something
to overshadow the great truths of history; we all
know that a man who has written many volumes
on a great historical subject took for granted that
a “Prince of the Empire,” above all a Prince of
Orange, must mean something in France. To those
whose studies lead them to look on <i>Imperator</i> and
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: basileus]">βασιλεύς</span>
as words which translate each other, it does
seem a pity if the style of Emperor should come
simply to be the English equivalent for
<span lang="grc" title="[Greek: tyrannos]">τύραννος</span>.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>But leaving smaller questions like these aside,
there is indeed one survival of the ancient Empire
before whose mighty history all minds must bend
in awe, a survival well nigh greater and more
memorable than that of which it is the survival.
When Gratian, the Christian <i>Imperator</i>, laid aside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the badges of the pagan <i>Pontifex Maximus</i>, truly
he did not foresee the day when a Christian <i>Pontifex
Maximus</i> should claim to place the crown of the
<i>Imperator</i> on his brow, and should even claim the
right to take away what he might in some sort
seem to have given. Christian Cæsars might indeed
repeat what a pagan Cæsar had said in unconscious
prophecy, that he could better bear the proclamation
of a rival Emperor than the election of a Christian
Bishop in the Imperial city. A day was to come
when, if men deemed that two great lights were
set in the Christian firmament, yet it was Cæsar’s
moon that shone with a feebler and reflected light,
a light that might suffice to rule the night of earthly
things, while the sun of the Pontiff shone with a
light that came straight from the Creator’s hand,
a greater light to rule the day of man’s spiritual
being. It might still be held that God had two
earthly Vicars, that two swords were placed by His
grant, each in the hand chosen to wield it; but the
sword that was wielded by the successor of Augustus
was held to be of baser metal and duller
edge than the sword that was wielded by the successor
of Peter. Great and mighty were those
claims, and great and mighty were once the men
who put them forth. Even Ghibelins in heart,
historic liegemen of Cæsar, must stand by and
wonder, if they cannot approve, when Cæsar stands
uncrowned, unclad, unheeded, at the Pontiff’s gate,
cast down from the throne of the world by a word
sent forth from Rome in Rome’s new character. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
one moment the lord of fifty legions is left, at the
bidding of an unarmed man, without a single sword
ready to leave its scabbard at his call. At another
moment he whose word has wrought such wonders,
himself in turn driven from his church and throne,
leaves the world with the protest that it is because
he has loved righteousness and hated iniquity that
he dies in exile, and is comforted in his dying hour
by the answer that in exile he cannot die, seeing
God hath given him the nations for his inheritance
and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession.
Rome again rules the world, and again rules it by
a moral power; she rules the world so surely that
she can again as it were turn her back upon herself;
the voice of her Pontiff can speak from Avignon as
the voice of her Augustus had once spoken from
Ravenna. But we must bear in mind that it was
simply because her Emperors had come to speak
from Ravenna and from a crowd of other spots
other than Rome, that a voice that would have
seemed as strange to Constantine as to Trajan had
learned to come forth, it might be from Rome, it
might be from Clermont or from Lyons. Let us
look at the case with the calm gaze of history.
History knows nothing of theories in which the
Roman Bishop appears as the centre of spiritual
unity, the divinely commissioned head of the Universal
Church. History knows just as little of
theories in which the Roman Bishop appears as
Antichrist and the Man of Sin. It may indeed be
the business of history to trace the steps by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
either theory arose in men’s minds; but it is not
by the light of such theories as these that she will
look at the facts of her own science. In the
eyes of history the power of the Roman Church
grew up simply because it was the Roman Church and
the Church of no meaner city. The church founded
in the mother and head of all cities could not fail
to rank as the mother and head of all churches.
Rome, the local Rome, still had life in her to rule,
and if her Emperor forsook his calling in the local
seat of rule, her Bishop was there to take his place.
When the sword of Valentinian was powerless against
the Hun, the voice of Leo was ready to charm with
all its wisdom. Claudius and Vespasian had brought
the elder folk of Britain beneath the earthly yoke
of Rome; when their work of a moment had passed
away, it was for Gregory to bring another folk of
Britain as more abiding dwellers within her ghostly
fold. Cæsar after Cæsar had given and taken away
the crowns of vassal kings; when Cæsar’s name had
become but a shadow in Western lands, it was for
the Roman Pontiff to bid shear the locks of the last
degenerate Merwing, to pour for the first time the
kingly unction on a Frankish head. In all these
cases, in a hundred others, Rome still speaks as the
head and teacher of the nations; she is driven to
speak through the voice of her Bishop simply because
her Emperor has forsaken her. How truly,
how wholly, it was the constant absence, the frequent
weakness, of the Emperor out of which the
power of the Pontiff grew will be seen by comparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the story of the Old Rome with the story of the
New. At Constantinople the Emperor was ever
present, ever reigning; where he dwelled and reigned
there was no room for any other power to take
to itself the slightest fragment of Imperial rule.
Never was any line of princes more deeply impressed
with a religious character than the Eastern
Cæsars; none more constantly made the Faith, the
advancement of the Faith, the humiliation of its
enemies, the abiding objects of their policy; their
style was the “Faithful Emperor;” their cry of
battle was “Victory to the Cross.” Nowhere were
Church and State more truly one; but nowhere
was the temporal ruler more distinctly in all causes
and over all persons within his dominions supreme.
In the West the present Patriarch had well nigh
taken the place of the absent Emperor; in the East
the present Emperor had well nigh taken on himself
the functions of a Patriarch who in his presence
was but his creature. Like his pagan predecessors,
it was he, and not the priest whom he appointed
and deposed, who was truly <i>Pontifex Maximus</i> as
well as <i>Pater Patriæ</i>. A Dante of the tenth or
eleventh century might have found the highest
Ghibelin ideal, the Augustus crowned by God, ruling
in God’s name as God’s Vicar but knowing no father
or lord on earth, in the mighty Emperors of that
day, in the men who turned from the toils of the
camp and the splendours of the court to tame their
own bodies with the hardness of a hermit in his
cave, in Nikêphoros seeking rest on his bearskin on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the earth for the stalwart limbs that had smitten
down the Saracen, in Basil with his girdle of iron
on his loins, marching forth to trample under foot
all that stood forth as either the foe of Christ or
the foe of Rome.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mighty and wonderful indeed are those the most
brilliant days in the long annals of the Eastern
Empire. Crete, Cyprus, Kilikia, won back from
the misbelievers&mdash;the Roman eagle again spreading
her wings over the Euphrates and the Tigris&mdash;the
cross again planted in what might seem to be its
special home at Antioch and Edessa&mdash;all show the
part which the Eastern Rome in her proudest days
could play in that Eternal Question which is in truth
the very substance of her whole history. Seated at
the junction of two worlds, called into being by her
founder as the special guardian of Europe and of
those lands of Asia which Europe had made her own,
as soon as the strife of West and East had changed
into a strife of Christendom and Islam, the Eastern
Rome was bound to be the foremost in the strife, or
she was untrue to the cause of her own being. The
Roman of the East, like the Spaniard of the West,
was of necessity a crusader before crusades were
preached; with both of them religion and patriotism
were in truth the same; men could not deal a blow
on behalf of their country which was not also a blow
dealt on behalf of their faith. We have already
glanced at this greatest of all the many instances of
Byzantine power of revival, the great days of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Macedonian Emperors. I call back your thoughts to
them again in order to carry out more fully the contrast
between the East fighting for its very being
against the unbelieving foe, fighting under the leadership
of its still present Imperial head, and the West
where the Imperial head fell away from the common
work of all, and left the leadership of the Empire and
of the kingdoms of the West to the spiritual power
which stood ready to do the highest of his duties for
him. When the West first marched for the deliverance
of the East, it was not at the bidding of the
Cæsar, but at the bidding of the Pontiff. In earlier
days, when the danger was at their own gates, when
new Attilas came, year after year, on the old errand
of havoc, Germany was indeed ready with men to do
once more the work of Aetius and the first Theodoric.
The Saxon kings, father and son, knew how to smite
the Magyar with blows more crushing than the Hun
had tholed on the Catalaunian fields. So, ages after,
men were not lacking to smite the Mongol at Lignitz
as the Hun and the Magyar had been smitten before
him. But in these wars men were fighting for their
homes and for their lives, for their faith only as part
of their homes and of their lives. When the great
cry of all came up, when to fight for the faith was not
to fight for men’s own homes and lives but for the
homes and lives of others, then the voice that spoke
was the voice, not of Rome’s Emperor but of her
Bishop. Some months back I strove to draw for you
a picture of the great day on which that voice was
raised, as part of the tale of the memorable land and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
city that listened to it. By the Bright Mount of the
Arvernian land, in the home of Sidonius and Gregory,
the word was spoken, at whose bidding men of every
calling short of kingship marched forth to do battle
for the sepulchre of Christ. The man to speak the
word should have been God’s Vicar in earthly things;
he who bade men draw the sword should have been
he who could bid them follow him as their loftiest
leader; the call to the Holy War should have been
in the West, as in the East it ever was, a decree that
went forth from Cæsar Augustus. But the two
swords had clashed in anger, the two lights shone
with hostile brilliancy; the days were passed when
the third Otto and the fifth Gregory might have stood
side by side at such a gathering; he who now drew
the sword at the bidding of Rome’s Emperor could
do it only at the risk of the ban of Rome’s oft-times
banished Bishop. Alexios Komnênos, vigorous
founder of a vigorous dynasty, was still not a Heraclius
or a Basil; but in the East the Emperor was
still ready in his own place to do his own work; he
had not vanished into some land beyond Mount
Hæmus, and left a Patriarch who acknowledged him
not to do the foremost duty of Empire in his
stead.</p>

<p>In later stages of the crusading strife Kings and
Emperors of the Romans did indeed take their share;
and the greatest success won by any crusaders since
the first fell to the lot of the Emperor who more than
any other drew down on his head the curses of the
spiritual Rome. Conrad went and came back; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
elder Frederick died on his march; but the second
Frederick, alone of Emperors, alone of European
kings, made his way within the long-fought-for walls,
and wore a royal crown in the city of Godfrey and of
David. Cursed first for not going on the crusade,
then cursed again for going, cursed most of all for
actually winning the prize of so many struggles, the
King of Salem had to fall back on traditions older
than Godfrey, older than David; he had to fall back
on the kingdom of Melchizedek, to place on his own
head the crown which no priestly hand would set
there. That the Bishop of the Western Rome should
strive to hinder the Emperor of the Western Rome
from winning the noblest prize that any Emperor
since Heraclius had won, shows more than any
other tale in history what a power had sprung up
in the bosom of the Empire to supplant the Empire
itself. A King of France, a King’s son of England,
might go on the now hopeless errand; no Emperor,
no German king, was likely to go and seek the misbelievers
in the Eastern lands with the memory of
Frederick before his eyes. A day was to come when
the misbelievers were to come and threaten Emperors
and German kings in their own realm. But before
that day came, one Emperor, fighting for the last
fragment of Rome’s Eastern power, was to win by
his fall such glory as no Emperor had for ages
won by his triumphs. And, even in the moment
of that glorious fall, he was doomed to show that the
Bishops of the Western Rome could be as deadly
in their friendship to the Cæsars of the East as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
could be in their enmity to their own sovereigns,
whether on the throne of Charles or on the throne
of David.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the event of the year
1204, the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, as
the point at which we must place the end of the old
and unbroken Empire of Rome in the East. High
indeed among the crimes and follies of recorded
history must we rank that exploit of princely freebooters
in crusading garb which broke in pieces the
ancient bulwark of Christendom, and left only feeble
fragments which could not fail to be swallowed up
one by one by the advancing Infidel. Men with the
cross on their shoulders, with their swords hallowed
to the service of the faith, turned aside from their
calling to carve out realms for themselves at the cost
of their fellow-Christians, and thereby to do the work
of the misbeliever more thoroughly than he could
ever have done it for himself. At the beginning of
the thirteenth century the paths of the Eastern and
Western Emperors had parted so far asunder that
the rival claims of the Greek and the German representatives
of Rome might well have died out in
oblivion. But the Western Rome had now another
representative whose claims could not die out. If her
Emperor no longer cared to assert his right to the
dominion of the world, her Bishop was ever ready to
make the claim. The men of the West were taught
to look on the Christian East as a schismatic land to
be won back to the true obedience; they were taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
that it was a worthy work to drive the pastors of
the Eastern Churches from their thrones and to instal
in their place dependents of the encroaching Bishop
of the West. Vassals of Rome in her new character,
a spiritual Prusias, a spiritual Herod, were to teach
once more the lesson of bondage to Greece and Asia,
to bid all lands look once more to the elder Rome as
the judge that alone gave forth judgements which none
might gainsay. It is indeed due to the memory of
the great Innocent to remember that it was not at
his bidding, but in direct disobedience to his straitest
command, that Frank and Venetian turned their
swords against Constantinople instead of wielding
them for Jerusalem. It was not at his word or with
his approval that men whose calling it was to
rescue the Temple of the Lord from misbelieving
masters, defiled the church of the Divine Wisdom as
no unbelieving master has ever defiled it. But Innocent
did not scruple to take advantage of the crimes
which he had forbidden, and to enlarge his spiritual
dominion by the help of the plunderers whom he had
failed to call off from their work of plunder. And so
the disunited East, a Christendom in which Christians
had ceased to be brethren, stood a ready prey for the
Infidel, strong in his unity, strong in the guidance of
the mightiest line of princes to whom the championship
of the Asiatic, now the Mussulman, side of the
Eternal Question had ever fallen.</p>

<p>For we have reached the days of the Ottoman.
Europe and Christendom had now to strive with a foe
more terrible than Carthage or than Persia, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
terrible than the Saracen of the East or of the West,
more terrible than the Hun, the Avar, the Magyar, or
the earlier tribes of his own Turkish stock. The
Arab had cut the Empire short; but in cutting the
Empire short, he had relieved it of provinces which
were no source of true strength, and thereby he had
given it for the first time somewhat of the life and
vigour of a nation. The Seljuk Turk had conquered
the lands which the Arab had ravaged but could
never conquer; but he had conquered them only by
making them a wilderness. He had fixed his throne
at Nikaia, but he had fixed it there only to fall back
again. If the Sultan of Rome ever dreamed that the
Eastern Rome itself was to be his, his dream was of
the kind which comes from the gate of ivory. But
the vision of Othman was the vision of a seer to whom
the future was laid open. He and his house were
not to be beaten back till they had reared a dominion
on Christian, on European, soil, which far more than
outweighed the winning back of the most western
land of Europe from Eastern masters. The Ottoman
was to become, what no other of the many earlier
invaders of his stock had ever become, not the mere
passing scourge, but the indwelling and abiding oppressor
of Christian and European lands. The Hun
and the Avar had been driven back or swept away
from the earth. The Bulgarian had bowed himself
to Christian teaching; he had cast aside his barbarian
speech, and had merged his national being in the
national being of an European people. The Magyar
had kept his name and his tongue; but he had made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
his way into the fellowship of Christendom and of
Europe; only, to the abiding loss of the nations of
South-Eastern Europe, his Christian teaching had come
from the Western Rome. The Mongol had fixed himself
on a far off march of Europe and Asia, to hold
from thence an overlordship over the most distant
and least known of European powers. The Ottoman
was to do more than these. He was to do what the
Arab and the Seljuk had striven in vain to do; he
was to fix his seat in the New Rome itself. And
more, he was to win the New Rome in the character
of an European power, and to storm its walls by
the hands of soldiers of European birth. When Mahomet
pitched his camp before Constantinople, it was
not, like the Saracen who came before him, in the
character of a lord of Asia invading Europe; he came
as one whose vast dominion on European soil had
long hemmed in the Roman world in that corner of
Thrace which he had kept as well nigh the last
morsel to devour. The conqueror of Constantinople
came as one who already ruled on the Danube, but
who did not as yet rule on the Nile or the Euphrates.
And he came as one who knew how to press into his
service the choicest wits and the strongest arms of all
the lands from the Danube to the Propontis as
well as of the lands from the Propontis to the Halys.
The institution of the Janissaries, that cruelest
offshoot of the wisdom of the serpent, had turned
the strength of every conquered people against itself,
and had changed those who should have been the
deliverers from oppression into the most trustworthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
instruments of the oppressor. The ramparts of Constantinople
were stormed by warriors of Greek, of
Slavonic, and of Albanian blood; the dominions of
the masters of Constantinople were administered by
statesmen of European stock, once of Christian faith;
whether the human prey kidnapped in childhood or
the baser brood who, then as now, sold their souls for
barbarian hire. In all the endless phases of the
Eternal Question, never had the powers of evil yet
devised such a weapon as this, the holding down of
nations in bondage by the hands of the choicest of
their own flesh and blood.</p>

<p>I would fain ask how many there are among those
around me who bear in memory that this day on
which we have come together<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is the anniversary of
the darkest day in the history of Christendom. The
twenty-ninth of May, the day so long and so strangely
honoured among us as the day of the birth and return
of Charles the Second, bears about it in other lands
the memory of events of greater moment in the
history of the world. It is the day of the fall of the
Eastern Rome, the martyr’s birthday of her last Emperor.
It was on this day that the barbarian first seated
himself on the throne of the Cæsars, that the infidel
first planted the badge of Antichrist on the most glorious
of Christian temples. From this day onwards
the Christian East has been in mourning, mourning
for the home of its Empire, for the holy place of its
faith. On such a day as this there should go up no
anthem of rejoicing, but the sad strain of the Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
gleeman who had seen a day of no less blackness; “O
God, the heathen have come into thine inheritance;
thy holy temple have they defiled, and made Jerusalem
an heap of stones.” But for the Hebrew
seventy years only of sorrow were appointed; our
captivity&mdash;for the captivity of the Eastern Rome is
the captivity of all Christendom&mdash;has gone on now
for four hundred and two and forty years as it is this
day. Now, as then, barbarians sit encamped as a
wasting horde in the fairest regions of the earth;
now, as then, the profession of the Christian faith
entails an abiding martyrdom on nations in their own
land. And heavier still is the thought that not a
few in Christian lands love to have it so. We daily
hear the strange lesson that “British interests,”
“imperial interests”&mdash;the interest perhaps of the
usurer wrung from the life-blood of his victim&mdash;demand
that we should do all that we can to prolong
the rule of the oppressor, to prolong the bondage of
the oppressed. We have seen the strange sight of
English statesmen rejoicing, as at some worthy exploit
of their hands, that they had given back to the
rule of the Sultan, that is to the bondage of the unbelieving
stranger in their own land, the men, the
women, the children, for whom the swords of better
men than they had wrought deliverance. With
shame like this done in our own day, we can hardly
turn round and throw stones even at the men of the
Fourth Crusade. They at least sinned for the human
motive of their own pelf; it is something for which
no human motive can be found when men rejoice in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the sorrows of the helpless lands which, after a
glimpse of the light of freedom, were again thrust
down into the night of bondage which that short
glimpse of light has made more black.</p>

<p>Let us remember then, as our story brings the tale
of the Eastern Rome to its end, that it was as it were in
the night that has just passed that the last Christian
worship was paid beneath the dome of Saint Sophia,
that it was as it were by the morning light of this
very day that the last Constantine took his post by
the gate of Saint Rômanos, to die, when to die was
all that he could do, for his Empire and for his faith.
And yet there is one thought which casts a shadow
over the end of the hero and of his power. The last
Christian worship beneath the dome of Saint Sophia
was a worship paid according to foreign rites, a worship
from which the men of the Christian East shrank
as from a defilement. So far had the ghostly power
of the Western Rome spread its shadow over all lands,
that the temporal help of the West could be won
only, or rather could be promised only and never
won, by treason to the old religious traditions of the
East. It was a brighter moment in the memory of
our fathers, a moment which has no fellow in our
own memory, when three of the great powers of
East and West, representing three of the great
races of Europe, three of the great divisions of
Christendom, Orthodox Russia, Catholic France,
Protestant England, fought side by side to break
the power of the barbarian on the great day of
Navarino.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>From the last European survival of the Eastern
Rome&mdash;for ever remember that a more abiding survival
still lingered for a while in Asia&mdash;let us turn
to another power which we can now look upon as
no more than a survival, the last direct survival of
the Western Rome. From Constantinople let us
turn to Vienna, from the Palaiologos to the Habsburg,
from the last Constantine to the first Leopold. For
two hundred and thirty years the flood of Ottoman
conquest had swept on; it was at last to be stemmed.
The Turk appeared, as he had appeared already, before
what we must now perchance call the Imperial
city of the West. But he fared in another sort from
that in which he had fared before the Imperial city
of the East. He had made his way into Constantinople;
he could not make his way into Vienna. He
made his way into Constantinople over the corpse of
a slaughtered Emperor; from Vienna he was beaten
back, but it was not by the arm of an Emperor that
he was beaten back. No king of another land came
to the help of Constantine; a king of another land
did come to the help of Leopold. Constantine fell
by the sword of a foe that was too strong for him;
Leopold found a helper who was stronger than his
foe, and devoted the full turnings and searchings of
an Imperial mind to find out with how little sacrifice
of Imperial dignity he could pay some feeble thanks
to the man who had saved his throne and life.
Vienna was saved for Christendom; it never shared
the fate of Belgrade and Buda. But it was the
sword of the Slave, the sword of the Pole, that saved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
it. Look on a hundred years, and the debt is paid
in full. Poland is wiped out from the list of nations,
and the house that the Pole had saved takes its share
of the spoils of its deliverer.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have ended my tale of Rome, my tale of Rome
in her many shapes and stages, in the last feeble survivals
of her power, in the more strange survivals of
her mere style. Once more I have to meet you before
the year, as years in this place are reckoned, comes to
its end. As I began by speaking of a world on which
Rome had not yet risen, I must end by speaking of a
world from which Rome has passed away.</p>

  <h2>LECTURE VI.<br />
  THE WORLD ROMELESS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I said</span>
in the opening lecture of this series that
one of the most wonderful features of the age in
which we live, an age which will assuredly take its
place in the Universal History of times to come as
one of the most memorable of ages, is that the world
is Romeless. I said too that this feature of the most
modern times is, by one of the great cycles of history,
a feature which takes us back to the earliest days of
European life. The world from which Rome has
passed away has something in common with the
world in which Rome had never shown herself. It
has something in common with it which it has not in
common with those later ages during which Rome,
in one shape or another, under one form of influence
or another, was the acknowledged centre of all
European and Christian lands. But this is one of those
many truths which can be grasped only by those who
look at European history as a whole, and who are
not led away by the delusive voices which would
teach them that this or that fragment of the unbroken
tale can be mastered by itself apart from the
other acts of the one drama. He who shuts up his
books and he who opens his books at any arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
point in Rome’s long story are alike shut out from
any true conception of the place of Rome in the
world’s history; they are shut out from understanding
the difference between an age in which Rome
is and an age in which Rome is not. To their
eyes the fact that the world is Romeless will not
seem anything wonderful, anything distinctive, because
they have never looked with any searching
gaze at the ages in which the world was otherwise.
Such an one will never see that the great
feature of the most modern times, a feature which
has reached its height in the times in which we
ourselves live, is the absence of any such centre as
the world so long gathered itself around. And if
he will not see that the world is Romeless, still
less will he see that even the Romeless world is not
as though Rome had never been. Rome is still
eternal in her influence; the world in truth has
been for ages so steeped in Roman influences that
those influences have ceased to be Roman. But
Rome, as a visible and acknowledged centre, has
passed away. No longer does an undivided world
look to a single Rome as its one undoubted head.
No longer does a divided world look to an Eastern
and a Western Rome as each the undoubted head of
half the world of civilized man. Rome œcumenical
in either of her seats has become a thing that is no
longer. The younger Rome has passed from us to
be the spoil of the barbarian. The elder, by a fate
at once more and less hopeful, has sunk to be the local
capital of a single European kingdom. The younger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in her present distress, has the loftier hopes for the
future. Her very oppressors have in some sort kept
on her traditions; they have kept her in her old
place as the head of something more than a mere
local realm. We are far more likely to see Christian
Constantinople again step into her old heritage as
the head of Eastern Christendom than to see the
lands of the West again accept the headship of
the elder Rome by the Tiber. The line of her
Cæsars is broken, broken, we may be sure, for ever.
Her Pontiffs have not wisdom enough to see how
their œcumenical position has been raised by deliverance
from the shackles of local sovereignty.
But to him who begins at the middle or at the end,
to him who leaves off at the middle&mdash;to him who,
under the influence of either error, has not given his
mind to grasp the whole tale from the kingship on
the Palatine to the kingship on the Quirinal&mdash;the
things which make our own age so wonderful are
things which lack a meaning. He who vainly
dreams that he will better understand his own times
by beginning his historic work with the times immediately
before them&mdash;he who listens to false
charmers who bid him seek, perhaps historic honours
but assuredly not historic knowledge, by preferring
the flashy glitter of some sixth or seventh period to
the solid work of his Gregory or his Einhard&mdash;he will
find out&mdash;no, he will never learn enough to find out&mdash;that
there is no royal road to the knowledge even
of his own times. His penalty will be to walk in an
age as strange and memorable as any that went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
before it, and not to know in how strange and
memorable an age it is in which he is walking.</p>

<p>We live then in a Romeless age, and to those who
have eyes to see it is one of the chief wonders
of our age that it is Romeless. But our age is
Romeless because we live in a world from which
Rome has passed away; those far-gone ages were
Romeless because Rome had not yet made her
way to the place which the world’s destiny had
marked for her. The position of those ages in the
general tale of European history was the subject
of the first lecture of this course six weeks back.
In that lecture and in the one which followed it
I strove to point out how Rome, having by slow
steps risen to the first place in the West, burst
suddenly into the midst of another political system,
a system of kingdoms and commonwealths which
was in many points a forestalling of the political
system of the world in which we now live. And
we may go yet further back, to days when Rome
was so far from being the head of the world that
her name could hardly have been known in the
world. By one of the strange cycles of history, we
who dwell in the wide world of modern times, the
world of continents and oceans&mdash;nothing better shows
its vastness than that we are driven to form a plural
for this last primæval name&mdash;have in some points
come back to the state of those who dwelled in the
narrow world of the earliest times, the little world
of islands, peninsulas, and inland seas. We have
come back to the state of things that was, not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
before Rome stood forth to rule the nations, but
before Macedonian kingdoms and Greek confederations
had cut short the right of every single town
on its hill or in its island to act as a sovereign state
in the affairs of the world. Each nation now, like
each city then, does what is right in its own eyes.
A nation now, like a city then, may be kept back
from the exercise of its inherent powers by dread
of the physical strength of some mightier neighbour.
But the nations now, like the cities then, acknowledge
no common centre of lawful rule, no power which
can speak to all with an authority higher than that
of physical strength. From our age the great
vision of Dante’s Monarchy has passed away, and
we have so far gone back to the condition of the
ages before whose eyes that wondrous vision had
never shown itself. The best witness to this fact
is to be found in the acknowledged importance
and the confessed difficulty of the doctrine of International
Law. At no time has it ever been more
needful than it is now to have a system of rules
by which a number of independent powers shall
acknowledge themselves to be bound. At no time
has it been found harder to enforce that system of
rules by any practical sanction. The simplest way
perhaps is that the weak state shall be held bound
to the strictest observance of every international
rule in its dealings with the stronger, but that the
stronger shall be held to be absolved from the like
pedantic minuteness in its dealings with the weaker.
A fancied insult, for instance, at the hands of Greece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
is held to demand a humiliating atonement which
would certainly not be asked for in the like case
at the hands of Germany. But the most subtle
International lawyer has failed to devise any means,
save the last argument of all, for bringing a great
power to reason which, to put it delicately, puts its
own construction on international rules, and is so
fully convinced of the truth of that construction
that it declines to submit their interpretation to the
decision of any arbiter. So it was in the days when
the civilized world was bounded by the independent
commonwealths of Greece. In theory certain rules
or customs were held to bind every Greek state in
its dealings with every other Greek state. Certain
acts which were deemed lawful if done towards
barbarians were deemed unlawful if done towards
fellow-Greeks. Such rules differed in no essential
respect from the International Law of modern times.
There is simply a verbal difficulty in applying the
name to the old Greek world, a difficulty arising
out of the fact that, in our present state of things,
nations have taken the place of cities. But among
Greek cities there was just the same difficulty in
finding a sanction for the wholesome rules laid down
by Greek tradition or religion which there is in
finding the like sanction now. There was no common
temporal authority; we can hardly say that there
was a common spiritual authority. The Amphiktyonic
Council had but feeble claims even to the
last position; its decrees went practically for nothing,
unless some powerful state undertook to carry them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
out for its own purposes, and claimed in return to
determine what they should be. In the days of
the great Peloponnesian war we do not hear of the
Amphiktyons at all. Then and later, Athens, Sparta,
Thebes, could trifle at pleasure with the rights of
a weaker city, subject only to the chance that some
other among the stronger cities might find it suit its
interests to assert the rights of the weaker. Every
Greek city had in theory an equal right to independence;
but Messênê, Skiônê, and Plataia felt
how hard it sometimes was to assert that right.
A treaty graven on a stone went for little, an Amphiktyonic
decree went for less, when a powerful
and ambitious city had other purposes to carry out.
Such a treaty, such a decree, went for about as
much as the agreement of a modern European
congress when it binds itself to secure the freedom
of Epeiros and the good government of Armenia.
The voice of some one overbearing city, say Sparta
backed by the will of the Great King, counted for
far more. The rise of the Macedonian power under
two renowned princes gave the Greek world for a
short space a centre and a head. International law
or its substitutes went for little when Alexander,
flushed with Asiatic conquest, wrote to all the cities of
Greece to restore their exiles. But when the Macedonian
kingdom again became only one power among
many, the old state of things came back again with
the needful changes. The world of Greece was no
longer a world of cities only; it was a world in which
cities, kingdoms, and confederations all played their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
part, a world in which diplomacy had its full run, in
which the eastern seas of Europe were ever covered
by embassies crossing one another in their endless
voyages to the court of this or that prince, to the
assembly of this or that confederation. It was into
this busy world of complicated International dealings
that the power of Rome burst like a thunderbolt. All
was at once changed. Under the Roman Peace, indeed
in days long before the Roman Peace was formally
established, as soon as Rome became by common
consent the arbiter of the Mediterranean world,
International Law had small opportunities left of
showing its strength or its weakness. For a while
the independent powers of the civilized world received
as law whatever decrees the mightiest among
them, the Roman Senate, thought good to put forth
in each particular case. As kingdoms sank into
provinces, as independent cities sank into municipalities,
the law of the one commonwealth into whose
substance they were in a manner merged became
the immediate law of the whole civilized world, with
the might of Cæsar Augustus as its sanction. There
might still be a <i>jus gentium</i> between Rome and
Parthia; to settle such questions as might arise at
Antioch, at Gades, or at Eboracum, there was only
the law of the Roman city of which all other cities
had become suburbs.</p>

<p>As long as any shadow of Roman power lasted,
the theory that there lived on at Rome a central
judgement-seat for the world was never wholly forgotten.
As East and West became, not only separate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
but hostile, as the Western Pontiff stepped for many
purposes into the place of the Western Emperor,
it was the ecclesiastical rather than the Imperial
Rome to which the nations sought as their common
judge. Still in either case it was Rome that spoke;
the world at least of Western Europe still acknowledged
a centre by the Tiber, though that centre might
have shifted from the Regia and the Septizonium
to the Lateran and the Vatican. The world of which
the Lateran and the Vatican were centres was presently
cut short by a spiritual revolt. And that
spiritual revolt was largely measured by national
distinctions. As Eastern Europe, Greek and Slavonic
Europe, had never admitted the spiritual dominion
of the Western Rome, so now Teutonic Europe cast
that dominion aside. Nations which had, in the
teeth of Emperors, asserted their independence in
the affairs of the world, now asserted their independence
no less in the range of man’s spiritual
being. The Church of Rome remained, like the
Empire of Rome, a power mighty and venerable,
but a power confined, if not within the bounds of
a single nation, at least within the bounds of a
group of nations closely connected in history and
speech. As there was a Holy Roman Empire of
the German Nation, so there was now a Holy
Roman Church of the Latin-speaking folk. In one
important point indeed we may say that the range
of the new Roman power was narrowed yet further.
There was a time when the bishopric of Rome, with
all that the bishopric of Rome carried with it, was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in practice as well as in theory, open to men of all
nations that admitted the spiritual power of Rome.
Now, though no law forbids the election of a Pope
of any nation, in practice the choice of the electors
has long been confined to men of Italian birth. This
privilege indeed might be looked on as in some
sort a survival or revival of local Roman supremacy;
more truly it is a falling back on days before the
spiritual supremacy of Rome began. It is a falling
back on times when the Roman church, still a local
church though the first of local churches, naturally
sought for its chiefs among its own members. But
so far as it is a falling back in either sense, it is
a falling back in a shape better fitted for later times;
here again the nation takes the place of the city;
Italy takes the place of Rome. In short the Roman
Church, still in theory coextensive with the world,
once really coextensive with Western Europe, has
shrunk up into a body mainly Latin with a head
exclusively Italian. It is indeed only in a broad
and general sense that we can take such propositions
as that the Latin nations clave to Rome while the
Teutonic nations fell away. That there are many
exceptions needs no proof. It is plain that the
Roman Church can still boast herself of not a few
Teutonic and Slavonic subjects. It is no less plain
that there are here and there, though in smaller
numbers, men of Latin speech, both in East and
West, who are not her subjects. Still the general
proposition is none the less true in its general sense.
It marks, to say the least, general tendencies which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
run a certain course wherever there is no special
cause to hinder them. If we look narrowly into
each case of exception, we shall often see some special
cause, commonly some political cause, which accounts
for the anomaly. We may note further that, as the
Empire became more purely German and the Papacy
became more purely Latin, the old feuds between Empire
and Papacy died out. The Austrian Emperors,
Catholic chiefs of an Empire mainly Protestant, had
no such warfare to wage with the Roman see as
had been waged by the Franconians and the Swabians.
But as Empire and Papacy alike came to
be thus shut up within narrowed and definite limits,
neither could any longer act as a common centre,
even for the Western lands. For better or for worse,
the world has fallen back on an older state of things.
Instead of a single Rome as the acknowledged head
of all, instead of two rival Romes, each claiming the
headship of its own half of the civilized world, it is
now open to every nation, as in the earlier day it
was open to every city, to do, as far as it finds to do
it, that which is right in its own eyes. Every nation
now, as every city then, may play the part of Rome
for the years or for the moments through which it may
keep enough of physical strength to play that part.</p>

<p>The latest times then are in truth a return to the
earliest times, with this difference, that nations have
taken the place of cities. Two of the masters of history
in later times have pointed out the close analogy
between the mutual relations of the cities of old
Greece and those of the nations of modern Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
The lesson has been taught us in its fulness alike by
Arnold and by Grote. It hardly fell within the
scope of either master to point out how truly the
likeness is a cycle, how the later state of things is a
return to the earlier, after the existence for many
ages of a state of things wholly unlike either. They
were hardly called on to dwell upon the causes which
have brought about this return to an earlier state of
things, or on the causes which made that return, as
every return to an earlier state of things must be, a
return only partial, a return largely modified by the
events which have taken place in the meanwhile. It
was enough for them to point the analogy. And the
analogy is answer enough to those shallowest of the
shallow who go about winning cheers from half-taught
audiences by declaiming on the uselessness of studying
the institutions of “petty states” and by asking
what can be gained by knowing about battles fought
two thousand years ago. The substitution of the
nation for the city is, from one side, part of the process
which we may, for our purposes, call the physical
growth of the world. The world in which we live
is in physical extent vastly bigger than the first
civilized world of old Greece, vastly bigger than the
far wider Mediterranean world of Rome. What the
Ægæan and its borderlands once were, what the Mediterranean
and its borderlands once were, Ocean and
his borderlands, his borderlands spread over so many
continents and islands, are now. No one ought to
be more ready than students of political history
to welcome every modern scientific invention. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
discoveries which have gone so far to annihilate distance
ought to call up our deepest thankfulness. But
we are perhaps thankful for them on other grounds
than those for which they are prized by their own inventors;
we are certainly thankful for them on other
grounds from those for which they are prized by
those who go about bragging about the worthlessness
even of the knowledge of times when those inventions
were unknown. The steamer, the railway,
the telegraph, are wholesome and necessary institutions;
they are wholesome and necessary in order to
hinder man’s intellectual and political life from being
crushed by mere physical extension. They allow the
England of our day to come nearer to the Athens of
Periklês than the England of a hundred years back,
of fifty years back. They allow the United States
of America, spread over a world wider than any age
of Roman empire, to abide as a Confederation free and
united, the true fellow of the old Achaia shut up
within the bounds of Peloponnêsos. They are needful
in an age when nations have taken the place of cities,
that they may make the nations really the political
equals of the cities. You may again, some of you,
chance to hear some smatterer sneering at petty states
ignorant of the great discoveries of natural science.
Tell him that the highest use of the discoveries of
natural science has been to raise large states to the
political level of small ones.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The causes which have led to the substitution of
nations for cities in the modern world are many,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
many more than I can attempt to deal with in this
lecture; but not a few of them are nearly connected
with the main subject of this course, the condition of
Europe in its three great stages, before Rome, under
Rome, and after Rome. I long ago defined modern
history, if the formula has any meaning at all, to
mean the history of the times in which the Teutonic
and Slavonic nations have held the foremost place.
Now among both these races the tendency to look to
the city as the natural centre of social and political
life has always been far less developed than it was
among the southern nations. We may say southern
nations in general; for if the highest developement of
the city belongs to Greece, yet it is also very strong
in Italy&mdash;let Rome and Capua bear witness; and if
the growth of the city life was much less perfect
among Gauls and Iberians than it was among Greeks
and Italians, yet Gauls and Iberians had certainly
made a nearer approach to it than Slaves or Teutons.
The causes of this difference, the detailed shapes in
which this difference shows itself, if I ever speak of
them at all, I must speak of some other time, and
after all they perhaps rather belong to the province
of the Reader in Anthropology than to mine. For
the present purpose we may simply accept the fact.
Take the highest type of each class. Greek political
society starts from the city; separate cities may be
grouped into confederations. Teutonic political society
starts from the tribe; separate tribes may be
fused into nations. I use the word <i>group</i> in one
case, the word <i>fuse</i> in the other, because in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Teutonic case the union has both happened far more
universally and has been far more perfect than in
the Greek case. We must take one more glance at
the old free Hellas, before the growth of Rome, before
the growth of Macedonia. Its ideal is the perfectly
independent city; it is only the experience of a later
age which leads cities to join into confederations.
The process is in some sort an unwilling one; we
may be sure that Sikyôn and Corinth would never
have given up one jot of their perfect separate independence
through any smaller motive than the need of
union among cities that had to escape or to throw
off Macedonian domination. The Teutonic political
unit, the tribe, or whatever we call the body of settlers
who occupy a <i>shire</i> or <i>gá</i>, holds another position.
Neighbouring and kindred tribes join into a nation&mdash;at
first most likely they join into some group greater
than the tribe and less than the nation&mdash;with far
greater ease than Greek cities join into confederations.
Some of the reasons are obvious. A city has in the
nature of things a more distinct and abiding political
being than a mere district, a mere space on the map.
Two shires may be physically rolled into one, and the
rolling into one does not carry with it any necessary
political subjection of one part of the new whole to
the other. Two cities can seldom be physically
rolled into one; the political union of two cities is
necessarily more imperfect than that of two districts,
and it is hard to unite them at all without giving
some degree of superiority to one over the other.
Again, the tendency of a tribe, whether wandering or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
settled in its district, is to the headship of a personal
chief, whether hereditary or elective; if the assembly
is the body of the tribe, the duke, judge, ealdorman,
is the head. The tendency of a city, whether aristocratic
or democratic, is to mere temporary magistrates,
who are not in the same sense heads either of the
city or of its assembly. Two or more dukes or ealdormen
can give way to a single king, or they can go on
exercising their office under a common king, with
very little shock to the constitution and habits of the
land and its folk. The assembly of the enlarged district
is simply an enlargement of the separate assemblies
of the two districts. It is by no means so easy
to fuse the assemblies and the magistracies of two
separate cities into one. The attempt is recorded to
have been once made in historic Greece; Corinth for
a while, no very long while, merged her separate
being in that of Argos; but before long Argos and
Corinth were again separate and independent cities.
In our own country the process by which the great
kingdoms of the Angles and Saxons were joined into
the one kingdom of England is perfectly well known;
we know nothing of the details of the process by
which those seven or eight great kingdoms, those
three specially great kingdoms, were gradually formed
by the union of earlier and smaller settlements. In
most cases we can see that such an union did take
place; we can even see that the process of union
took different shapes in one kingdom and in another;
but the details are hidden from us. One reason of
our ignorance among many may well be that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
process was gradual and easy, carrying with it no
great immediate change. We need not suppose that
the union of Wessex or of Mercia was wrought by a
series of treacherous murders like those which united
the whole Frankish nation under Chlodowig. But
the ease with which Chlodowig could root out all
the other Frankish kings, the seeming good will with
which he was received as king by each division of the
nation, shows that the process was an easy one.
Even when it was done by force, it would carry
with it no special wrong beyond the force by which
it was done. The Ripuarians really lost nothing by
accepting the Salian king.</p>

<p>At a later time the opposite process has taken
place in many lands. Gaul and Germany after a
very near approach to union, Italy after an approach
far more distant, split up again into a crowd of
states, practically if not formally independent. The
still abiding theory of the Empire forbade either the
free city or the duchy or county to put on that
avowed independence which had belonged to every
free Greek city, to every barbarian kingdom, in the
days before the Empire was. But practically cities and
principalities took to themselves all the powers of
independent states, even to that of making war on
their overlord. In Gaul indeed, besides the splitting
up of the land among the dukes and counts, there
was the splitting off of the land itself from the body
of the Empire. As the German poet sings;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <p>“Et simul a nostro secessit Gallia regno,</p>
    <p>Nos priscum regni morem servamus, at illa</p>
    <p>Jure suo gaudet, nostræ jam nescia legis.”</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">In that part of Gaul which became France in the
later sense, we might even say that a nation was
forming and splitting in pieces at the same moment.
It is hard to distinguish the process by which the
house of Robert the Strong became Dukes of the
French from that by which they became Kings of
the French. In either case we see that the word
<i>Franci</i> now means, at least west of the Maes and
the Saone, something very unlike what it had meant
in the days of Chlodowig. The new nation, the
nation formed out of three elements, the <i>Mischvolk
der Franzosen</i>, the nation which still kept in Latin
the name of the old Teutonic Franks, is fast forming.
Its language is forming; there is a <i>lingua Romana</i>
of Northern Gaul, which is felt to have become
distinct from the <i>lingua Latina</i> of books, which is
felt before long to be distinct from the other forms
of the <i>lingua Romana</i> in Italy, Spain, and Southern
Gaul. There is a French people, speaking a French
tongue. But the nation, while forming, is splitting
asunder. At the very moment when the duchy of
France is changing into the kingdom of France, a
crowd of smaller duchies and counties are falling off
from it. By the strangest chance of all, the duchy
is dismembered on behalf of Scandinavian settlers.
Their coming might have been almost expected to
call into fresh life the waning Teutonic element in
Gaul. In truth the new comers from the North,
while keeping all their native energy, became disciples
of French speech and French culture; and it was in
truth their help which enabled the French kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
to come into being. The typical Romance nation
was thus formed, itself a nation in the strictest
sense, though it has since done much to absorb and
assimilate parts of the other nations on its borders.
Yet we may perhaps see in the growth of the
French nation, at least as compared with England
and Scandinavia, some influences from the city-life
of more southern lands. The nation grows round
a city in a way in which no Teutonic nation has
done; Paris is the centre, nay the cradle, of France
in a way in which no chief city of any Teutonic
land can be said to be. The other cities, the
ancient heads of tribes, kept a headship over the
districts which shared their names such as never
belonged to the towns of England. When we pass
out of France into Southern Gaul, we find another
state of things, a state of things approaching to that
which is to be seen in Italy, a state of things far
more nearly recalling the elder state of Southern
Europe. In both lands the cities, though not forming,
as in old Greece, the whole political life of the
country, are a conspicuous element; in Italy they
are the predominant element. As the power of the
Emperors gradually died out in their kingdoms of
Italy and Burgundy, the land split up into a crowd
of practically independent states, among which free
commonwealths again played their part alongside of
principalities. On the greatness of the Italian cities
I need not now dwell; but it is important to remember,
first, that, though the history of the cities
is the most brilliant and the most attractive part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
mediæval Italian history, yet the cities never spread
over the whole land, as they did in old Greece;
secondly, that the political phænomena of Italy
appear, though with less brilliancy and for a shorter
time, in the neighbouring lands of Gaul. Provence,
the land once so deeply touched by Greek influences,
had for a moment her commonwealths no less than
Lombardy. Massalia, which had braved the might
of Cæsar, again braved the might of Charles of Anjou,
and found the Frenchman a far harsher conqueror
than the Roman. Aquitaine too, the other land of
the tongue of <i>oc</i>, if not so distinctly republican
as Provence, yet stands distinguished from France
as emphatically a land of civic growth and civic
privilege. The importance and independence of the
cities grow as we go on a south-eastward journey
through England, France, Aquitaine, Provence, and
Italy.</p>

<p>We have been opposing cities to nations; but it
is easier to define a city than to define a nation.
I think we may say, at least for our purpose, that the
ideal nation is found when all the speakers of the
same tongue on a continuous territory are united into
a single political whole, which includes no speakers of
other tongues. The nation in short should have
unity of speech and unity of government. It would
be hard to find a nation which exactly answers this
definition, but the nearer a political body answers to
it, the nearer surely does it come to the highest type
of a nation. I think that, when we find anything
else, when we find men of several tongues under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
same government or men of the same tongue under
several governments, we instinctively ask the reason.
The reason may be a good one or it may not; but we
cannot help asking the reason; the thing is, at the
first look of it, an anomaly. Now free cities, with
all their merits, are the greatest of all legitimate
hindrances to national unity. I say of legitimate
hindrances, of hindrances which come of themselves
and which have something to be said for them, as
distinguished from hindrances caused by external and
unrighteous force. Italian unity was impossible as
long as Milan and Venice were kept apart from the
Italian body by the brute force of the House of
Austria; but Italian unity was no less impossible in
the days when Milan and Venice&mdash;Milan for a moment,
Venice for ages&mdash;played a part in the affairs of the
world as independent commonwealths. Italy, the
land of free cities, has, largely because it had been
the land of free cities, been of all the lands of Europe
that which most thoroughly split asunder, that which
most thoroughly became, in the well-known words of
her enemy, a mere geographical expression. Germany,
in her most divided days, was still far from
being so utterly divided as Italy. Save during the
few years of French ascendency, her princes and cities
always kept up some kind of mutual relations towards
one another. Germany always had a national Diet;
Italy had none.</p>

<p>The Italian nation has been at last united in our
own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we
may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is
surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of
the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out
the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on
our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms
part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no
longer even a geographical expression. The island
realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the
kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result
of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice
without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of
sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of
the history of Europe with which we have throughout
been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully
snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated
Rome. Of all novelties in European history the
greatest was when Rome became the centre of a
dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the
head in short of a local Italian kingdom. “Rome the
capital of Italy” was a formula which might well
gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which
formally swept away the œcumenical position, the
œcumenical traditions, of Rome. Till that day some
shadow of her œcumenical position had lived on.
Under the temporal dominion of her Bishops, she was
indeed the temporal capital, not of all Italy but of
a part. But the temporal headship of the part did
not wipe out the œcumenical position as is done by
the temporal headship of the whole. Rome was not
the mere head of the Papal States; the Papal States
was something which her Bishops held as a temporal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
appendage to their position as Bishops of the œcumenical
city. But the kingdom of Italy is not an
appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom.
The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by
her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has
become less than Italy. By becoming the willing
head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast
aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast
aside when brute force made her the head of a French
department. The deliverance of 1870 was the formal
record of the fact that, in the sense in which I used
the words in the opening of this lecture, the world is
Romeless.</p>

<p>While Italy then, the special land of free cities,
was slow in rising to national unity, the neighbouring
land in which free cities showed themselves only for
a moment has never reached national unity at all.
Bondage to the modern map, the familiar use of
geographical names only in their most modern sense,
hinders men from seeing that the lands of Southern
Gaul, the lands of the tongue of <i>oc</i>, that is Aquitaine
and the Imperial Burgundy, had in them all the
elements of national life just as truly as Italy or
Spain, or as that very France in which their national
being has been merged. We are apt to talk as if,
because those lands are French now, therefore they
have been French from all eternity, or at least as if
it had been in the eternal fitness of things that they
should become French some day. Aquitaine indeed
owed a formal and nominal homage to the French
crown; but Provence and the other Burgundian lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
were as fully independent of the Kings of Paris as any
land of Spain or Italy. The Karolingian dominion,
that Frankish kingdom which had grown into a
Western Empire of Rome, broke up, as our own
Chronicler has told us better than any other record,
into the four kingdoms of Germany, Burgundy, Italy,
and the Western realm that was to become France. In
the course of ages the Western kingdom has annexed
the Middle kingdom; it might have been the order
of things that the Middle kingdom should annex the
Western. The course of the world’s history might
have been that, instead of Arles, Vienne, or Lyons
bowing to Paris, Paris should bow to Arles, Vienne,
or Lyons. In a land whose geography was so largely
ruled by ecclesiastical divisions, it might not have
seemed wonderful if the seat of the Primate of
Primates or of the Primate of all the Gauls had won
even temporal precedence over the simple bishopric
of Saint Denys and Saint German. The reason why
no South-Gaulish nationality was able to maintain
itself is most likely to be found in the specially
divided political relations of those lands. Aquitaine
and the Imperial Burgundy have so much in common,
so much that is utterly unlike anything in
France, that, had they had the faintest chance of political
union, they might have formed a true nation.
But there was no moment, under Romans, under
Goths, under Franks, when the two lands formed
a political whole apart from any other land. Aquitaine
and Burgundy were ever parted, each by itself
was split in pieces, while Neustria and Austria ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
kept some measure of union, enough to enable them
to grow into the great realms of France and Germany.
And so the Kings of Paris could bit by bit swallow
up the divided land. They could not only annex the
lands west of Rhone which owed them a formal
homage, but they could spread their power, slowly
and surely, over the fairer lands, the more royal
cities, which knew no king but Cæsar.</p>

<p>But a fragment has escaped. Cities there still are
of the old Burgundian realm, cities both of Romance
and of Teutonic speech, from which the kingship of
Cæsar has passed away, and which have not bowed
the neck to any meaner lord. The Middle kingdom
still has its representative in Europe; but that representative
is no longer a kingdom but a free confederation.
Massalia the twice free&mdash;Aquæ Sextiæ with
her memories of Roman victory and Provençal countship&mdash;Arelate
where kings took their crown in life
and Vienna that sheltered them in death&mdash;Lugdunum
whose name once spread to the Ocean and the British
sea&mdash;all these have passed away; but Lausanne and
Geneva still sit unchained beside their lake&mdash;modern
freedom has not wiped out the memory of ancient
kingship at Neufchâtel and Payerne&mdash;Basel, Basilia,
in her very name brings up the thoughts of Empire,
fit thoughts in a city where men so long defied the
claims of Rome in her newer garb&mdash;and high above
them all, younger and mightier, still stands the city
by the Aar, the home of old patricians, the city
looking forth upon her subject mountains, the Bern of
Berchthold, yet nobler than the Bern of Theodoric,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the city which, in days when the Middle kingdom
might seem to have been forgotten, a poet of her own
could greet in a twofold garb,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry" lang="de">
    <p>“Als Krone im Burgundenreich,</p>
    <p class="i2">Als freier Städte Krone.”</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There is thus still a free and abiding fragment of
the old realm of that King Boso who, when men
questioned his kingship, could tell them that he was
“Dei gratia id quod sum.” But of a Burgundian
nationality Europe now knows no trace. The fragment
of free Burgundy that is left has joined with
two other brands snatched from the burning, a fragment
of Germany, a fragment of Italy, to form
a political nation, none the less truly a political
nation because it does not coincide with any nation
defined by blood or speech. A fragment of the
English folk, a fragment of the British, a fragment of
the Irish, joined together to make for us that people
of the Northern England which, among its other
merits, has kept alive, under another name, the
purest form of the English tongue. If we could not
spare Scotland in our island world, our <i>alter orbis</i>,
still less could we spare Switzerland in the wider
world of the European mainland. A fragment of the
German, the Burgundian, and the Italian folk, have
come together to show us, in this age from which the
power of Rome has vanished, one lively image of the
age when the œcumenical power of Rome had not yet
risen. Athens, like Rome, has sunk to be a seat
of local kingship; Achaia still lives, if not on her own
Mediterranean shore, yet in the lands which repro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>duce
her political life. She lives in a figure in the
mountain land, the home of all that is oldest and
newest in Western tradition and Western thought.
And she lives too in a figure in the vaster federal and
vaster English land beyond the Ocean. We indeed
feel the Unity of History to be a living thing when
we see the work of Markos of Keryneia and Aratos
of Sikyôn reproduced on two such widely different
scales in the younger hemisphere and in the elder.</p>

<p>Thus in the Latin-speaking lands and on the central
march of the Teutonic and Latin-speaking lands
nations have grown up of themselves, they have
failed to grow up, or they have been formed by an
artificial union. But the city, as an independent
political unit, has vanished. Even in Switzerland
the city is subordinate to the artificial nation; and
we can hardly say that any Swiss canton is now
a city commonwealth in the older sense. The people
of the surrounding district, once commonly a subject
district, have everywhere won for themselves equal
rights with the people of the town. If <i>Baselstadt</i>
is a purely town-community, it is because <i>Baselland</i>
has won for itself, not only equality but separation.
In other lands the cities are simply members of the
kingdom or commonwealth, though we have seen
that, where cities once were great, nations have found
it harder to grow into nations than elsewhere. In
other parts of Europe, Celtic, Teutonic, Slavonic,
nations have grown up without reference to cities at
all. The Teutonic and the Slavonic political units
are both something very unlike a city; the Celtic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
political unit is something yet more unlike. In
none of these parts of Europe did the native political
developement take the course which it took in Greece
or Italy or even in Gaul, and the Roman influence
was naturally immeasureably less than it was in
Southern Europe. In all these lands the city is
everywhere a direct importation from the South.
It may be a real Roman colony; it maybe a Teutonic
or Slavonic community shaping itself after the
pattern of a Roman colony. Nowhere was the city
a thing of purely native growth, nowhere was the
independent city the ruling political idea around
which all political life gathered. In one land
indeed, in the central land, the land which took
specially to itself the Teutonic name, cities did indeed
become great and famous; but they became great and
famous only under the conditions which I have just
laid down. It was fitting that the German nation
which sheltered its own Holy Roman Empire should
conform to Roman traditions more nearly than England,
Scandinavia, or the Slavonic lands. Cities
therefore became an important element in the German
kingdom. The oldest Germans looked on a walled
town as a prison; yet in after days cities and city-life
found the German land no unkindly soil. The Roman
cities by the Rhine lived on, and became models for
cities of more purely Teutonic birth. The Colony of
Agrippina had its capitol no less than the Tolosa of
Quintus Cæpio, and it seemed only in the nature of
things that patricians should gather round it. Saxon
kings, Saxon dukes, made younger cities arise after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
their model in the heart of the German land or on
the shore of the Northern Mediterranean. Nor must
we forget that other cities at which we have glanced
already&mdash;will any one grasp my meaning and all that
it suggests if I speak of one of them as “Verona in
montibus?”&mdash;were simply cities of the German realm,
to which circumstances gave in the end a fuller freedom
than their neighbours. Zürich herself, “nobile
Torregium,” “die uralte, löbliche, eidgenössische Stadt,”
reckons among her titles of honour that the judgement-seat
of Cæsar was so often held within her walls.
In course of time that special home of Imperial power
passed away, together with her fellows, from all dealings
with Cæsar and his Empire. Others clave to their
old allegiance till a new <i>Francia</i> reaching to the Baltic
and the Hadriatic supplanted the ancient realm which
was at once <i>Francia</i> and <i>Romania</i>. Those free cities
of the Empire which lingered on till our own century
came, like the cities of the Alpine land, of divers forms
of growth. Augsburg&mdash;Augusta Vindelicorum&mdash;proclaimed
herself to all time as of Roman and Imperial
birth; round Nürnberg none but Teutonic memories
can gather. And by the Northern and the Eastern sea,
by the banks of Weser, Elbe, and Trave, cities arose
which were called to a still higher and a more abiding
destiny. Merchants, missionaries, self-styled crusaders,
joined their efforts to plant German cities on the
conquered shores of the Wend and of the older folk
beyond him, folk beside whom modern Europe and
her nations feel as intruders on foreign soil. The
League of the Saxon Hansa, a power for which, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a League, we can hardly find a geographical place on
land, became mighty indeed and memorable upon the
seas. London and Novgorod formed parts of one
union of trade and enterprise; the merchant cities
could give law to the kingdoms of the North and
could place whom they would on thrones which in
Cnut’s day had looked to Winchester and which were
now taught to look to Lübeck. But here too, as
in more southern lands, the greatness of cities was
not abiding. The League drooped; its members
fell away; three only lived through the last storm
to claim a revived freedom in the first new birth
of Germany seventy years back. Three-and-twenty
years ago I saw those cities still sovereign and independent;
in theory more sovereign and independent
than they were in the days of their might.
On the coins of Lübeck was still graven, if not the
image, yet the superscription of Cæsar; the Hanseatic
city seemed to have put forth no marks or shillings
since the days of the first Francis from Lorraine. But
Cæsar lived only in his superscription; Lübeck knew
no lord on earth; she was bound by no ties save
those which bound her to her two Hanseatic sisters
and to the lax Confederation which still numbered
a single inland city among its members. The next
year after my visit the tale of free cities was shortened,
the freedom of those that still lived on was
shortened also. Frankfurt has sunk from the rank of
a commonwealth to become a city of a local kingdom;
Lübeck, Bremen, Hamburg, are still commonwealths,
but commonwealths which are again members of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Empire. They are survivals, but survivals which
modern Europe, Romeless Europe, the Europe of huge
kingdoms and of countless armies&mdash;happy when kingdoms
mean nations and when armies do not simply
keep down unwilling subjects&mdash;cannot spare from the
midst of her. The age of free cities is past; in some
lands the mere high-handed robbery of the stranger
has wiped them out, as where the fetters of the
meanest of oppressors still clank over enslaved
Ragusa. In other lands the loss of local freedom
has perhaps been outweighed by admission into a
wider national unity. In two lands again the commonwealths
still abide, tempered only by the obligations
of a federal tie. But a federal tie is one thing
when it binds together a group of lands and cities
none of which could now stand alone; it is another
thing when the federation has an Imperial head, when
three surviving cities are grouped with duchies and
kingdoms which could at any moment overwhelm
them, and when duchies and kingdoms are again
grouped in fellowship with another kingdom greater
than cities, duchies, and kingdoms joined in one. Yet
to this day the free city, even if shorn of its old
greatness, its old independence, is still an element in
our modern Europe. Those three surviving cities of
the great Hansa are precious fragments indeed, fragments
in one sense of a world when the Roman power
had put on its German garb, reminders in another
sense of a world on which the Roman power had not
yet risen. As we trust never to see the day when
the bull of Uri and the bear of Bern shall cease to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
badges of a freedom more than municipal, so we
trust never to see the day when Imperial Germany
shall cease, among the ensigns of its free confederate
members, to reckon ensigns more worthy of honour
than the banners of dukes and kings, the towers of

<p>I have done my desultory picture of our Romeless
world, desultory and imperfect as must be every
picture attempted in lectures such as these, the object
of which is not the communication of minute knowledge
on any point. I am still at the threshold of
my work. Some solid work I think I have done in
inner chambers with the small and faithful band who
follow me, who sometimes guide me, through book after
book of the historian of the Franks. But what I have
as yet preached, so to speak, on the house-tops has been
in its own nature general and desultory. I have not,
strictly speaking, been teaching; I have been purposely
talking in a way which might call up memories
in some and might stir up to inquiry in others. But
through the general we make our way to the particular.
Next term I trust to make even these more
public lectures of a more solid kind. I have run
with a swift pace through a general view of the
Methods of Historical Study, through a general view
of the chief periods of European history. This last
series fills up for this year the tale of forty-two
lectures which the iron rule of our masters demands
from me. With such necessity laid upon me, I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
think it savoured of arrogancy and impiety if I
ventured on such a voluntary work of supererogation
as a forty-third lecture. What the Commissioners
deem enough you doubtless deem enough; so to-day I
bring my desultory story to an end. In October I hope
to begin a more regular course, and to make a path,
through a true understanding of the early history of
Gaul, to a true understanding of the early history of
Britain. And I have one word more to say. Since
I came here I have learned several things, I have
learned one in particular. I have hitherto always
shrunk from crying my own wares, from advertising
my own writings. Whenever I have quoted myself
or referred to myself, it has been with a feeling of
doing something that one should be ashamed of. But
I have learned in this place where I now stand, from a
colleague who is now no longer a colleague, how very
silly such modesty is, and how much better it is to
quote oneself and talk of oneself as freely as one
quotes and talks about anybody else. I will tell
you then that a few years back I gave two courses
of lectures on the other side of the Ocean which,
I venture to think, contain matter worth reading. I
think they contain matter specially worth reading by
those who think of following my roundabout course
in company, first with the Vandal who crosses the
Rhine and afterwards with the Saxon who crosses
the sea. They were printed in America; some copies
have, I know, found their way into Britain. I must
put a bold face on the matter, and say that those
who have followed me thus far and who purpose to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
follow me again in October might spend their Long
Vacation worse than in giving some part of it to
reading my two courses of Lectures to American
audiences, bound up in one not very big volume.
You will find in them some things that I have said
elsewhere, and, though some seem to think that impossible,
some things that I have not said elsewhere.
And so I bid you farewell for a few months, finding
fault with you in nothing, except that, like most
other Professors, I wish there were more of you. But
one therefore feels all the more kindly to the elect,
the faithful, the little band that watched with Ælfred,
the stout hearts that lapped with Gideon, even though
they be far from reaching the full tale of three
hundred. And so I will end the work of my first
academic year, with a wish to see you all and more
also on the same benches in October; I part from
you with the blessing of the modern Greek,

  <h2>GREEK CITIES UNDER ROMAN RULE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span>
in various forms tried to point out the
special importance which, in the history of the
world, belongs to the period which saw the establishment
of the dominion of the Roman People over the
civilized world of its time, especially over the Hellenic
and hellenized lands round the eastern Mediterranean.
It is of the first importance for the right
understanding of general history to take in the real
character of the state of things which was brought
about by this gradual establishment of the Roman
dominion. It is curious to see how constantly that
state of things is misunderstood, from looking at
the matter with modern eyes. And it is the more
curious when we come to think how very modern
the eyes must be which are unable to see the matter
correctly. For we have hardly to go out of our own
century to find lively images of the state of things
which Roman conquest brought about. Yet we are
constantly tempted to fancy that the rule of the
early Roman Emperors, perhaps that of the Roman
Commonwealth before them, was a centralized administration,
in which all authority issued from a
central power. We are used to the great kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
and commonwealths of modern Europe, in which
local bodies may enjoy a greater or less degree of
local independence, but in which they hold that
independence in inherent subordination to the central
authority, by virtue of laws passed by the central
legislature. The land is divided into counties, departments,
provinces, administered according to such
rules as the central legislature may think good to
lay down. It is true that in our own country the
shire is, both in idea and in part of the land in
historical fact, older than the kingdom. But in a
large part of England the shire is as truly a division
of the kingdom as a French department, and where
it is not so historically it has become so practically.
An English shire, an English borough, has no rights
or powers but such as it has derived, in some shape
or another, from the central power of the land, by
act of Parliament or by royal charter. That central
power has the same rights and powers in every
corner of the kingdom. I speak of course only of
the United Kingdom; as soon as we get beyond its
limits, as soon as we enter the Scandinavian kingdom
and the Norman duchy which lie so near to it
but which form no part of it, so soon we still find
ourselves in a state of things which has much in
common with the Roman dominion. And if all this
is true of the United Kingdom, it is yet more
true of states like France and Italy, whose geographical
divisions and administrative system have
been drawn up as something wholly new in quite
modern times. Yet down at least to the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
last century, in many parts of Germany, of Italy, of
Switzerland, of all the lands to which the power of
Venice reached, the endless varieties of alliance and
subjection between different towns and lands presented
the closest analogies to the relations of which
I have now to speak. Survivals went on even to
our own time. In 1865 a small district was still
held in <i>condominium</i> by the two free cities of
Lübeck and Hamburg. I passed through it with a
feeling as if I had been carried back into some
distant age. I presume that since 1866 things are
different there.</p>

<p>It is of course perfectly true that, at a later age of
the Roman dominion, when the Empire began to
change into an acknowledged monarchy&mdash;though
monarchy is not the proper word for a power which
was often held by two or more colleagues&mdash;that
Empire did come much nearer to the character of a
modern centralized state. It was mapped out into
administrative divisions, and those divisions were
administered according to a general law. But the
dominion of Rome, Commonwealth and Empire, had
been in being for several ages before this change
took place. The elder Roman rule was not the rule,
despotic or constitutional, of a man over an united
territory; it was the rule of a city over other cities
and lands, cities and lands standing to the ruling
city in every possible relation, from nominally equal
alliance to a subjection hardly better than bondage.
That so it should be was the natural result of the
way in which the Roman dominion was formed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
With the political ideas of the third and second
centuries before Christ no other state of things was
possible. The way in which the dominion of Rome
was formed, the process by which the cities and
lands of so large a part of the world passed under
the supremacy of one ruling city, has much in
common with the further process which the growth
of that dominion made inevitable, the submission of
Rome herself to the dominion of one or more of her
own citizens. In both cases the change was gradual.
People often talk of the change from the Republic
to the Empire, very much as they talk of the
English Reformation, as if it were a definite act
which took place in some particular year. Yet all
that was characteristic in the Imperial power arose
out of its gradual growth, its growth through an
union of magistracies and extraordinary commissions
which virtually bestowed supreme authority on their
holder. Above all, out of the original character of
the Empire as an extraordinary commission granted
by a vote of the Senate came the fact that the
Empire remained for ages without any law of succession.
A law prescribing a mode of election and a
law prescribing a rule of hereditary succession both
assume an ordinary office which must be filled by
some one; the Empire was in its origin an extraordinary
office which might not be filled at all. A
vote, or several votes, of the Senate entrusted a
single citizen&mdash;or more than one citizen&mdash;with
powers which practically amounted to sovereignty,
and which in the end grew into acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sovereignty. But that growth was slow. For a
long time after the Empire began, the republican
constitution, the republican magistracies, the republican
assemblies, still lived on untouched in their
outward framework. They had simply lost all living
energy through the growth of a power greater
than all, a power which sometimes directed their
course of action, sometimes itself acted in their
stead. If we could conceive, as once or twice did
happen for a short time, the controlling power removed,
that is, if the extraordinary commissions
which made up the Imperial power were not granted
to any one, the old elements of the commonwealth
were there, able again to act for themselves as of
old. The Senate, after ages of utter nullity, actually
did act again as an independent body when the Goth
was at the gates of Rome and the Emperor was far
away at Ravenna. For Rome once more to act
without her master there was no need to create any
new power, but simply to take the fetters off an old
one. In the earlier ages of the Empire, when the
old traditions were more lively, when the forms of
the old constitution were still observed, such a
change would doubtless have been far more easy.
A modern kingdom cannot be changed into a republic
without an active change in its constitution.
The executive authority must be vested in some
new power to be created and defined for the purpose.
The Roman Empire might have been turned back
into a republic by a purely negative change. All
that was needed was not to appoint an Emperor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
The various powers of the State which had left off
acting or had come to act only as the Emperor bade
them, would doubtless, from lack of practice, from
change in all surrounding circumstances, have found
it practically impossible to act as they had done in
the days of the old commonwealth. But there
would have been no formal hindrance to their so
doing; there would have been no need to clothe
Senate or magistrates with any powers beyond those
which they still held, though in a dormant state.</p>

<p>The power of Rome over her allies and dependencies
during the Commonwealth and the early Empire was
very much of the same kind as the power of the
Emperors over Rome herself. It was something which
overshadowed a crowd of old powers and liberties,
which brought them down to practical nullity, but
which in no way formally abolished them. The republican
institutions of Rome under the early Empire,
the constitutions of the allied states, of the dependencies,
even of the direct subjects of Rome, under both
the early Empire and the Commonwealth, were much
in the same state as a man or a beast that is fettered
or bridled. His inherent physical powers of action
are not lessened; only they cannot be exercised, or
can be exercised only according to the will of a
master. So it was with Rome herself under the
Emperors; so it was yet more strikingly with the
dependencies of Rome under Rome republican or
imperial. As Rome herself submitted only gradually
to the rule of her Emperors, so the dependencies
of Rome submitted only gradually to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
rule of Rome. There could hardly have been one
Roman province in which, as in an English county
or a French department, every inch of soil stood
in the same relation to the central power. Within
the geographical bounds of most provinces, above
all within the bounds of the Greek and hellenized
provinces, there were cities and districts standing
to Rome in all those endless relations which were the
natural result of the different times and the different
circumstances under which their connexion with
Rome began. Here was a free and equal ally of
Rome, a city which Rome had been glad to receive as
a free and equal ally at a time when her alliance was
really valuable. Nothing had happened to give any
excuse for dragging down the old ally to any inferior
position. In theory she was still as free as ever,
keeping every power of a sovereign state within and
without. No Roman magistrate had any authority
within her territory; if she sent offerings to Rome or
to Rome’s master, if she supplied a contingent to a
Roman army, all was the gift of pure friendship from
one equal ally to another. A neighbouring town
might be in the strictly provincial relation; over her
soil the Roman people had become, not only sovereign,
but landlord; she might keep her old municipal constitution,
but it was purely by the grant or sufferance
of the ruling city. Such a city yielded obedience to
Rome, because Rome was an acknowledged mistress;
if its free neighbour practically yielded obedience to
Rome no less, it was simply because, in an alliance
between the weak and the strong, the strong will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
always give law to the weak. And between these
two extremes there were endless intermediate shades.
Besides the absolutely independent ally, there were
allies who also had treaties with Rome, but whose
treaties were less favourable, treaties which bound
both sides alike, but which formally placed one of
the contracting parties in a higher and the other
in a lower position. Again, there were towns of the
province itself on which Rome had bestowed, not by
treaty but by her own grant, higher rights than the
rest of the province. One city was free, keeping its
own law, exempt from the ordinary jurisdiction of
the Roman governor, paying no tax or tribute to
Rome, but holding all these privileges by grant from
the Roman state. Another was equally free within
its own walls, but bought its privileges by the payment
of tribute to Rome. And as there were within
every Greek-speaking province spots which remained
spots of free Hellas abiding in their old freedom, so
there might be other spots which were transplanted
fragments of the soil of Latium or of Rome itself,
keeping in the foreign land the rights of Latium or
of Rome. That is, there might be within the bounds
of the province Latin or Roman colonies, or towns to
which, without being in their origin Latin or Roman
colonies, Rome had thought good to grant, sometimes
her own full citizenship, sometimes only the half-citizenship
of Latium. Of these, the free and allied city,
the Roman and the Latin colony, were geographically
within the province, but they were not legally part
of it. To the Roman and the Latin colony we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
nothing exactly answering in modern Europe; but
Andorra and San Marino are still lively illustrations
of the position of a small state which has powerful
neighbours. San Marino, a perfectly independent
state, but which, as wholly surrounded by its great
neighbour, is practically cut off from exercising any
of the external powers of an independent state, is in
exactly the position of a free and equal ally of Rome.
Such an ally might keep perfect internal freedom,
but it was in the nature of things cut off from any
foreign policy. Andorra, a dependent and tributary
state, though keeping full internal freedom, would, if
it had only one protecting lord, also have its parallels
among the dependent allies of Rome. But, in the
complication of mediæval relations, Andorra has two
protecting lords, two receivers of tribute. That was
a state of things which could not be in the days of
the Roman Peace.</p>

<p>There is only one San Marino within the geographical
bounds of Italy, and San Marino is not one of
the great cities of Italy. It is therefore a harmless
political curiosity, with whose rights the Italian
kingdom has no temptation to meddle. It might
be otherwise if the kingdom had many such independent
towns and districts within its borders, and if
any of the great cities of Italy were reckoned among
them. Now one of the ugliest features of Roman
history, one which comes out in every page of the
history of the second century <small>B.C.</small>, is the ungenerous
way in which Rome treated her independent allies
the moment they ceased to be useful to her. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
long as they served as checks on some other power,
so long they were made not a little of; as soon as
the dangerous power was overthrown or humbled,
the ally which had helped to overthrow it became
an object of Roman jealousy. The friendly power
whose day of usefulness was over was exposed to
endless attempts on the part of Rome to weaken and
break it in pieces. Such is the tale of the kingdom
of Pergamon, of the city-commonwealth of Rhodes,
of the confederation of Achaia. No part of Roman
history is more disgraceful than the dealings of Rome
with those three states, the model governments of
their several classes. No learning, no eloquence, can
avail to whitewash the faithless and brutal dealings
of the Roman Senate towards powers whose only
fault was to be weaker than Rome and to have done
good service to Rome. This feeling of jealousy towards
the allies lingered on long after all ground for
jealousy had passed away, when the free city was free
only within its own walls, and could not lift hand or
foot against the mighty ally by whose dominion it
was hemmed in. But the wrongs of these cities
under Roman rule were far more largely due to more
immediate causes, to the overbearing love of power,
to the baser love of gain, which formed the dark side
of the Roman character. The liberties of these weak
states were often encroached on, not only by the Roman
state itself, but by particular Roman magistrates, and
even by powerful men who were not at the moment
magistrates. The establishment of the Empire undoubtedly
did something to check the oppressions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the Roman governors, on whom there was very little
check under the commonwealth. But if the Empire
led to less oppression on the part of the representatives
of the central power, it led to more meddling
on the part of the central power itself. A man placed
at the head of the world stands in a different position
from a city placed at the head of the world. To the
ruling city the dependent states are simply dependent
states; it gets what it can out of them, but it has no
temptation to meddle for the sake of meddling. The
ruling man has temptations to meddle, and it may
even be that, the better disposed he is, his temptations
to meddle become greater. The natural tendency
of the Empire was to unity and centralization
everywhere and in every way. Under imperial
rule, the endless variety of relations among the
allies, dependents, and subjects of Rome gradually
changed into the one character of direct members
of the Roman Empire. But the change was slow.
Sovereign commonwealths sank into municipalities,
and municipalities sank into something less than
municipalities, by mere force of circumstances, without
any formal act. It is often very hard to say
when this or that free city finally lost its distinct
being through absolute incorporation in the Roman
Empire. It is certain that the memory of past freedom,
as something that still was not wholly past, lived
on for ages. Under the early Empire the commonwealths
of Greece and Asia, whatever was their
formal relation, were in practice, not only subject to
the Roman Empire, but very much at the mercy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the governors of the provinces within which they
geographically lay. But they still were commonwealths,
though dependent or even subject commonwealths.
Their senates, assemblies, or other ruling
bodies, had practically sunk to the functions of town-councils,
and they were open, in a way in which an
English town-council is not, to the caprice of an external
power. But they were town-councils which
had been sovereign parliaments. Some of them were
in theory sovereign parliaments still. And even those
which were furthest from that character, the councils
of those towns which were neither free and allied
states, nor Roman colonies, nor in any way privileged
above the general provincial relation, had not wholly
lost their original character. Deep into the time of
the Empire, the old character of the Roman dominion,
that of a city ruling over other cities, still left its
traces. In such a state of things the authority of
the councils or assemblies of the subject states might
practically be smaller than that of the town-council
of an English borough. That is, the assembly might
be afraid of acting in any matter of importance without
the leave of the central power or its representative.
It might practically confine its action to matters
of routine and ceremony, at most to votes of honours
and setting up of statues, because any bolder action
would awaken Roman jealousy. That is to say, the
free and allied state could in theory do everything,
even the provincial town could in theory do many
things, according to its own free will. But generations
of submission to an irresistible neighbour had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
taught it not to exercise that free will except according
to the higher will of the power which was
supreme over all. If the rights of the subordinate
state became formal or even null, it was because they
were wide and indefinite; they were the powers of a
community which still kept a distinct being, but
which was placed under the irresistible influence,
sometimes under the direct dominion, of a stronger
community. This is a position altogether different
from that of a town or district in a modern kingdom
or commonwealth where every part of the land has
equal rights. In such a kingdom or commonwealth,
whatever powers, great or small, this or that board
or council has, are held according to the law of the
land. As long as those powers are exercised according
to the law of the land, no administrative interference
is to be feared; if the law is broken, if the
local authority steps beyond its legal powers, the
wrong will be made good, not by an arbitrary will,
but by a legal process. It was wholly different with
the cities of which we speak, whether free, dependent,
or subject; they were still separate commonwealths
with inherent rights, even if those rights could no
longer be exercised; their assemblies had once been
parliaments, and to both the forms and the feelings
of parliaments they still clave. And one city at least
among the allies of Rome kept its substantial freedom
down to an age when many fancy that the Roman
power itself had altogether vanished from the earth.
The freedom of Cherson was overthrown, not by
Mummius in the second century on one side, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
by Vespasian in the first century on the other, but
by the Amorian Theophilos in the ninth. Till that
day the last of the Greek commonwealths lived on
its ancient life, and for the simplest of reasons. Not
only the Emperor himself, but the proconsul of
Achaia, of Macedonia, or of Asia, could at any moment
encroach on, the Emperor could at any moment
destroy, the freedom of any Greek city that lay geographically
within those provinces. He had always
the physical power to encroach or to destroy; not
uncommonly he had the will. But the commonwealth
which lay far away in the Tauric Chersonêsos stood
in another case. The faithful ally could not be
changed into the helpless subject, except by the
same kind of effort which was needed for a Gothic
or a Persian war.</p>

<p>The long abiding independence of Cherson is a fact
to which I have often had occasion to call attention
from other points of view. So is the independence
of the Lykian League, though the less favourable
geographical position of that power allowed its freedom
to come to an end eight hundred years sooner
than the freedom of Cherson. I have elsewhere
spoken of that League as perhaps the most skilfully
planned example of a federal constitution that the
elder day could show;<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it concerns me now as an
example of the degree of independence which a considerable
territory could keep under the general
supremacy of Rome, from the fall of Perseus to the
reign of Claudius. For the story of its origin we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
have to go to the narrative, unhappily fragmentary,
which Polybios gives of the events which led to the
deliverance of Lykia from Rhodian rule;<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for a full
account of its constitution we have only to turn to
the description of Strabo.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is specially instructive
when the geographer tells us that the League still kept
the right of war and peace, though, he adds, in his
day that right could not be exercised at all, or could
be exercised only as Rome thought fit.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> After reading
this, it is certainly curious to read the comment
of a recent scholar who thinks that the powers of the
League and the measure of its independence were
something like those of the city of London.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A
nearer analogy might surely be found in the relations
in which many of the smaller powers of Europe stood
not very long back; it is not very unlike that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
which some of them stand at this moment. The
position of Lykia towards Rome is very like that in
which various Italian and German states stood towards
Austria forty years back. It is very like that
in which Servia at this moment stands to Austria and
Montenegro to Russia. It is in short the position
of a “protected” state, whether the protection be
avowed or only practical. But there is this important
difference. A protected state now has at least
some voice in choosing its protector; it can exercise
the old Teutonic right of seeking a lord. And a small
state may even keep perfect independence without
any protector at all, simply through the jealousies of
the greater powers. A small state may sometimes live
on in perfect freedom surrounded by powers stronger
than itself. Any one of them could at any moment
put an end to its freedom; but none of them is likely
to make the attempt, because the others, for their
own ends, will not allow it. But Rome stood alone
in the world; there was no choice of protectors;
whatever independence was left was held only by
Roman sufferance. Whenever it suited Roman policy
or caprice to extinguish the independence of any
state, the thing was done.</p>

<p>The Lykian League, as embracing a considerable
territory, has, from its geographical side, more in
common with the kingdoms and principalities which
lived on under Roman vassalage, than with the single
city-commonwealths which supply the examples which
most naturally occur to us. It must have been beyond
the power of any single proconsul in a peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
time seriously to interfere with the liberties of Lykia.
It is true that the federal states of Greece still lived
on for Pausanias to see them at work; and two
generations earlier the sacred convocation of the
Amphiktyons had drawn a new life from the measure
of redistribution ordained by the Emperor Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But we may be sure that no confederation of old
Greece kept anything like such a measure of political
life as that which Strabo saw at work in Lykia. What
little life there still was in the Greek world abode in
the single cities, and there was doubtless more life
among the Greek cities of Asia than in those of old
Greece. Of Lykia in Strabo’s day we have only
Strabo’s general description; we have no detailed
illustrations of the working of the political system;
least of all have we any speeches, any letters, any
political treatises, either from Lykian orators or philosophers
or from Roman magistrates who had dealings
with the Lykian League or its cities. Let us leap on
to the age of Trajan, and we shall find that that age
is rich in materials for the political life of the Achaian
and Bithynian provinces and of the free cities which
lay within their geographical boundaries. We have
four highly instructive contemporary writers, two
Greek and two Latin, one of the latter being the renowned
Emperor himself. We have from Plutarch
a treatise on the duties of a Greek statesman of
his day. We have from Diôn Chrysostom several
speeches actually delivered in the assemblies of Greek
cities in the reign of Trajan. We have the corre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>spondence
of Trajan himself with the younger Pliny
when Pliny was proconsul of Bithynia. We thus
get two sides of the picture. We see how things
looked in the eyes of two literary Greeks, one of
whom to be sure was bound to make the best of
things and to make his rhetoric as acceptable as he
could to his Greek hearers. We see also how things
looked in the eyes of two official Romans, an Emperor
and a proconsul who were among the best of their
several classes, but whose very virtues laid them open
to one special temptation. Both Trajan and Pliny
loathed oppression and wrong of every kind, and they
sincerely sought the welfare of all for whose welfare
they were responsible. But for that very reason they
were more likely to be led to constant meddling with
the affairs of their subjects than rulers who might
now and then be guilty of some gross piece of tyranny,
but who for the most part left people alone in the
time between one act of oppression and another. The
colouring on the Greek and on the Roman side is very
different; but the main outlines are the same in both
pictures. In both cases we see cities which keep
much&mdash;which in some cases keep everything&mdash;of the
outward show of free commonwealths, but which do
not dare to exercise their powers, even in very small
matters, without the knowledge and good will of the
Roman prince or his local representative.</p>

<p>The political treatise of the wise and kindly Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
is one which cannot be read without sadness.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
To a Greek, a Bœotian, living in a land which had
once been so great and which was so utterly fallen,
the contrast between what had been and what was
came more keenly home than it could come to his
Asiatic contemporary. The cities of Diôn’s native
Bithynia had never been so great in the past, and
they were far more prosperous in the present, than
the cities for whose would-be statesmen and orators
the sage of Chairôneia had to give rules. But in
both writers we find things looked at from the same
general point of view. Local independence is assumed
as the state of things which exists at least in theory.
We read page after page of both Plutarch and Diôn
without any hint that the commonwealths of which
they were speaking had any superior beyond their
own walls. Both write in a way in which no one
would write for the instruction of a newly-chosen
town-councillor in a modern state. It is for parliaments,
not for town-councils, that the whole language
is fitted. But ever and anon we come to some passage
which shows us that the parliaments with which we
are dealing are parliaments working in fetters, parliaments
which can practically do nothing without the
approval of a foreign superior. In our own land we
find the nearest parallel in ecclesiastical bodies, and
the likeness is increased by the fact that the range
within which the Greek assemblies of that day were
most active was that which concerned religious worship
and that large class of subjects which in Greek ideas
were connected with religious worship. A Convocation
organized like a Parliament, carrying on its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
debates as freely as a Parliament, but whose acts go
for nothing unless they have the licence of the Crown
beforehand and the consent of the Crown afterwards,
a Convocation which, without ever being suppressed,
without ever having its formal meetings interrupted,
could be practically suspended for a hundred and fifty
years, has far more likeness to one of these Greek
assemblies than can be found in a local body whose
powers are narrowly defined, but which can freely
exercise such powers as it has. We have another
parallel in the Chapter electing its Bishop, electing
him freely according to all outward look, but whose
choice not only needs the approval of the Crown, but
is actually dictated beforehand by the Crown, under
heavy penalties if that dictation is not obeyed.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We
read several chapters of Plutarch which might have
been written for any Greek commonwealth in days
before either the later or the former Philip. Presently
the mention of certain demagogues who corrupted
the people by shows of gladiators is a sign that the
Roman has entered into the Greek world.<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But, for
anything in that or in several following chapters, the
commonwealths so corrupted might have been as independent
as when earlier demagogues were said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
have corrupted their countrymen by allurements of
other kinds. We go on further, and the full truth
comes out. The Greek commonwealths of Plutarch’s
day had no longer anything to do with wars, with
alliances, with putting down of tyrants, and some
might think that in such a state of things there was
no room for statesmanship left. Plutarch thought
otherwise; there were still public trials at home;
there were embassies to be sent to the Emperor; there
were dealings with Roman governors, possibly with
bad governors. These things needed some qualifications;
energy, daring, discretion, were all needed by
those who had to plead for the weak before the powerful.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The chosen magistrate was not to despise his
office because he had not so free a field as the magistrates
of old times; but he was never to forget the
difference between him and them. Periklês might
say that he was called to rule among freemen, among
Greeks, among Athenians. The magistrate of Plutarch’s
day was to remember that he ruled with a
ruler over him; that his city was in subjection to the
proconsuls of Rome, to the procurators of Cæsar.<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
War was impossible; of freedom they had as much
as their masters left to them, as much perhaps as was
good for them<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> when Greece was so weak, when
there was no power left in her which the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
bidding of a proconsul could not upset.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In such
times public men must be careful to give no offence,
no occasion, to dangerous neighbours; they must above
all avoid such occasion as was given by disputes at
home or with other cities. At the same time, while
fully understanding their dependent position, they
must avoid base cringing and flattery; they must not
make the governor yet more of a master than he is
disposed to be by calling him in on all occasions;<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and it will be wise to make some powerful Roman
their friend.<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> They will do well to study the records
of old Greece, but only for examples suited to the
actual state of things; tall talk about Marathôn and
Plataia and Eurymedôn should be left to the rhetoric
of the schools; but peaceful examples from earlier
times, examples of courtesy, humanity, and good faith,
were as instructive then as they ever had been.<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The precepts of Plutarch are perfectly general.
He draws no distinction between the different classes
of cities, according to the greater or less degree of
independence which they still formally kept. For
in truth they were all practically in the same case;
all had, in his own phrase, the shoe of the Roman
over their heads.<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The provincial town could act
freely in many things, if the governor did not choose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to meddle; the independent ally could not act freely
in any thing, if the governor did choose to meddle.
We find things on the whole the same when we turn
from the philosopher giving wise precepts in his
study to the orator actually haranguing the assemblies
whose duties Plutarch so carefully lays
down. Diôn Chrysostom is a rhetorician by profession,
and he has the faults of his profession;
but there is much that is attractive about the
man and his writings, and he gives us several
instructive pictures of Greek life in his own day.
His orations on subjects of theoretical politics, on
kingship, aristocracy, democracy, and the like, sound
a little unpractical under the universal rule of
Rome; but we must remember that it mattered a
good deal whether the reigning prince was Domitian
or Trajan. We gain real additions to our knowledge
from the picture of the Euboian hunter, possessed of
the civic franchise but who had never been in the
city, and we learn better what an Euboian city was
like in Diôn’s day.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> More interesting still is his
picture of the Greek city of Olbia or Borysthenês,
still clinging to its Greek speech and manners amid
the constant attacks of dangerous barbarian neighbours.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Of more importance for our purpose is his
oration to the Rhodians, an oration of good advice,
but of course largely mingled with panegyric on his
hearers and their city. This is a document of deep
interest, if read by the light of the history of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
illustrious island in the second century before Christ.
Rhodes is throughout addressed as a free commonwealth,
as a democracy;<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> it is the one Greek state
besides Athens which keeps its freedom;<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> it is the
only one which still cherishes the glory of the
Hellenic name.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The relations of the state to Rome
are nowhere dwelled upon after the manner of
Plutarch; Emperors are several times casually
mentioned, but not as masters;<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the point of connexion
between Rhodes and Rome of which the
orator is most inclined to speak is the part played
by the Rhodians in the Roman civil war.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He
knows of no break between the mighty Rhodes of an
earlier day and the still flourishing democracy which
he harangues. Some of his sayings could hardly
have been approved by Plutarch; they are too much
in the Marathôn and Eurymedôn style; but they
could not, even as flourishes, have been addressed to
a people who were not free, at least in theory,
however precarious might be the tenure by which
their freedom was held.</p>

<p>Less interesting in themselves than any of these,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
but perhaps in a certain way more instructive, are
the speeches which Diôn makes in his own city of
Prusa and in other towns of his native province.
He had to preach peace and concord both to rival
cities and to rival parties in the same city, and also
to plead his own cause against his own enemies.<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The
assemblies which he addresses are always assumed to
be self-acting bodies; references to the existence of
Rome come in only casually, and Diôn does not
often copy the plain-speaking of Plutarch.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But
the speeches of the Greek orator put on a tenfold
interest when we come to compare them with the
memorable correspondence which is luckily preserved
to us between a Roman Emperor and a proconsul
of Bithynia in Diôn’s own day. The letters which
passed between Trajan and Pliny seem at first sight
to describe a wholly different state of things from
that which appears in the speeches of Diôn. If we
compare the two, we shall see that they set before
us two opposite sides of the same state of things.
From the two together we shall get a clear notion of
the state of the various cities of Bithynia, and of the
different relations in which, like those of any other province,
they stood to the ruling power. Speeches and
letters together illustrate the show of freedom which
existed in perhaps every case, the reality of freedom
which existed in some cases, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the precarious tenure by which both the shadow and
the reality were held. We see the ordinary provincial
town, still keeping the style of “res publica,”
passing “psephismata,” sending “legati” to the Emperor
and the neighbouring governors, playing in
short at being a commonwealth, but not venturing
to do any local act of the least importance without
consulting the Emperor’s representative. Diôn brings
out one side, Trajan and Pliny bring out the other
side; that is all. Diôn makes a speech to the
people of Nikomêdeia, exhorting them to peace and
harmony with the people of Nikaia. Many passages
would have been in place in the mouth of a mediator
between Athens and Sparta five hundred years
earlier. There is no direct mention of any superior
authority as bearing rule over both; the orator
indeed tells his hearers that after all they cannot
make war on their enemies,<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and warns them lest
by their dissensions they make the Greek name
ridiculous among the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> We are for the
moment amazed when we turn from this picture of
two seemingly independent commonwealths to the
letters which show how the Emperor and his representative
had to be consulted by Nikomêdeia,
Nikaia, and every other city, about the smallest
municipal regulations, about every kind of local
improvement.<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is an odd comment on the dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>sensions
between city and city of which Diôn speaks,
when Trajan, remembering how Nikomêdeia and
other cities had been torn by seditions, will not
allow the creation of a company of firemen, lest it be
turned to some dangerous political purpose.<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> We
again feel sure that Pliny, in his zeal, meddled in
many matters which a worse proconsul would have
left alone, and that, in his desire to do right, he
referred many things to the Emperor which such
a proconsul would have settled for himself in a high-handed
way. Reading speeches and letters together,
we better understand both. We are dealing with
commonwealths, but with commonwealths acting in
fetters. They do everything for themselves by
votes of their own assemblies. But those votes need
a licence beforehand, a confirmation afterwards, or
both the one and the other, from the overruling
power that stands without.<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Both Nikomêdeia and Nikaia, and Diôn’s own city
of Prusa, were only ordinary provincial towns
with no special privilege. But there were spots in
Bithynia which were more highly favoured. Here,
as elsewhere, the Roman colony, the free and allied
city, were locally in the province, but not of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
It is plain that even cities of this rank were used to
a good deal of meddling on the part of the Roman
officers; but they resented such treatment and
appealed to their privileges. Apameia was no provincial
town, but a Roman colony. Diôn, who claimed
to be one of its citizens, made a speech before
its senate, in which he sets forth the dignity of its
colonial character.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Pliny, more busy than other
proconsuls, claimed to look over the accounts of the
colony. The colonists told him that he was welcome
to do so, that it was their common wish that he
should do so. But he should remember that it was
a thing which no proconsul had ever asked before;
their ancient privileges gave them the right of
managing their own commonwealth as they thought
good. Pliny asks for and receives a statement of
their case in writing. He thinks much of the paper
irrelevant; but he sends it to the Emperor to be
guided by his judgement. In all this correspondence
one somehow thinks of the correspondence of
Augustine and Gregory; the superior is so clearly
the wiser man of the two. Trajan writes back that
the straightforward dealing of the men of Apameia is
to be respected; the proconsul is to tell them that it
is by the Emperor’s special request that he asks to
look at their accounts; he is to do so without any
prejudice to their privileges for the future.<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
here see plainly enough the difference inherent in
the position of a Roman colony as distinguished
from that of an ordinary town of the province.
Still an Emperor and a proconsul less scrupulous
than Trajan and Pliny might have made short work
of the liberties of Apameia. Under the men with
whom the colonists had actually to deal, those
liberties, when once established by sufficient evidence,
were safe.</p>

<p>But within the geographical limits of Bithynia
there was something yet higher than a Roman
colony. Amisos was an independent state surrounded
by Roman territory. The city had in past
times seen many settlers and many masters; it was
at last delivered from its oppressors by Augustus
Cæsar, and it became a free ally of Rome, bound to
Rome only by the terms of its treaty.<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We know not
what those terms were; they may, like treaties with
Gades and Aitôlia, have formally bound Amisos to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
respect the majesty of Rome, or they may not.
That difference mattered little to a commonwealth
whose geographical position compelled it in any case
practically to respect that majesty. But it mattered
greatly that, within its own walls, Amisos was by
right perfectly free, governed by its own laws, which
might or might not agree with the laws of Rome.
Still it is plain that its treaty rights could not
always secure the commonwealth from the meddling
of Roman proconsuls. And it again marks the
difference between the servant and the master that
Pliny speaks of the liberties of Amisos as existing
by the indulgence of Trajan, while Trajan himself
grounds them directly on the faith of treaties. The
proconsul asks if an <i>eranos</i>, a benefit club, is to be
allowed in Amisos. Such a question marks the way
in which the rights even of a perfectly free city were
liable to be interfered with. Trajan, as we have
seen in the case of the Nikomêdeian firemen, had a
great dislike to unions and societies of any kind
which might possibly be turned to political ends.
No <i>eranos</i> is to be allowed in any city that is subject
to the laws of Rome. But at Amisos, a city ruled
by its own laws, Pliny is not to interfere with the
establishment of such a body. The way in which
the great Emperor speaks is remarkable. The might
of Cæsar stands disarmed before the majesty of
treaties. Trajan carries out a certain policy wherever
he has the legal right to do so; where he has
no such right, he forbears. Yet his words seem to
imply that even he, the just Emperor, might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
interfered with the rights of the free commonwealth,
had he seen really good cause for doing so.<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> What
other Emperors and other proconsuls did, with or
without cause, it is easy to guess.</p>

<p>It is not at all wonderful if most of the business
done by the assemblies of these commonwealths had
to do with religious and social matters, and again
with formal and trifling matters, with votes of
honours, statues, and the like. As Diôn several
times tells them implicitly, as Plutarch tells them
more directly, the decision of greater matters had
passed into other hands. The point is that these
cities still kept the form of commonwealths, commonwealths
that must have passed most of their lives in
fear and trembling, but still commonwealths, even
if in fetters, not mere municipalities, such as we are
used to in our own day. In Eastern Europe and
Western Asia this state of things is the direct and
necessary consequence of the events of the Polybian
age. The history of the Roman power in Western
Europe is a wholly distinct subject. There Rome
did not enslave or destroy, but created. The towns
of the West looked forward, while the Greek
commonwealths looked backward. The gradual extinction
of these last was the necessary consequence
of later changes, of changes which followed on the
centralizing and despotic tendencies of the later
Empire. Much of local independence had vanished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
between Strabo’s day and Pliny’s; the Lykian
League itself was a thing of the past when Trajan
respected the privileges of Amisos. How late any
traces of freedom lingered we need not here inquire.
My present object is to show the long abiding effects
of the peculiar process by which the Roman dominion
was definitely formed in that great determining period
of the world’s history which is marked by the second
century before Christ.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6">[6]</a></span> In writing this article I have had several times in my thoughts
a controversy on “Home Rule under the Roman Empire,” which
will be found in two numbers of <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> for
November 1882 and March 1883. This controversy is instructive in
many ways, specially as showing how utterly, and how contentedly,
large parts of Roman history and Roman literature may be passed
by, even by a scholar who enjoys a high repute in other branches
of those subjects. The comparison between the Lykian League and
the city of London comes from the second of the two articles. Its
author could hardly have read the description of the League in
Strabo.</p>

were chosen by the Chapters. By long-standing custom a
nominee of the Crown was always chosen, though there was not,
as in the case of the election of Bishops, any legal obligation
so to do.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
